{"instruction": "Why did my portable solar panel not work when I plugged it into the solar receptor on the side of my camper van?", "input": "", "output": "Solar is a lot more complicated than just a panel and a battery. Even if you have a system that is pre-wired for solar panels, there is no guarantee it will work right away. This can lead to much frustration and the need to learn more about electrical systems than one may wish. First, a solar controller is needed for all solar-powered systems. Solar controllers regulate the incoming energy, and limit the amount of watts a system can support. Many solar panels come with a solar controller built in, but if you have a system pre-wired with existing solar panels that you are trying to add to there is likely already a solar controller. Adding an additional controller will prevent the new panel from working. If one does not know about solar controllers it can be very difficult to figure out, and may lead to angry overnight Amazon shipments of multimeters to determine what is breaking. However, multiple solar controllers is not the only potential problem. Different solar panel manufacturers have different cord types and connector types, and even within a type of connector there is the idea of “polarity” - the direction a connector needs to be plugged in. This can also lead to internet research, frustration, and more overnight Amazon orders of polarity switching adaptors. If one is especially unlucky it will rain all day once all parts finally arrive, delaying testing of the system."}

{"instruction": "Why are iPhones more popular than Android phones inside the United States, while the opposite is true outside the United States?", "input": "", "output": "The primary reason why iPhones are more popular inside the United States than outside the United States is cost. Because many companies manufacture and sell Android phones, the cost of an Android phone is low. On the other hand, Apple is the only company that sells iPhones, and this lack of competition allows Apple to charge a higher price. The United States has the highest per capita household income of any country in the world, thus people in the United States are more able to afford iPhones than are people outside the United States. A secondary reason for iPhone’s relative popularity in the United States is cultural: an iPhone is seen as a sort of status symbol, and some iPhone features only work with other iPhones, thus some people feel they will be “missing out” socially if they have an Android phone instead of an iPhone."}

{"instruction": "Why is it so rare to see a unseeded tennis player win a grand slam?", "input": "", "output": "To raise a grand slam trophy, a player has to win 7 consecutive best of 5 set matches and in all likelihood against several top 10 players. Tennis is considered to be a demanding sport both physically and mentally. The players have to be in top shape and be ready to duel out many tough 5 set matches during the course of the slam.  During grand slam matches, players can run anywhere from 3 to 4 miles with most of the movement being lateral. The top players have the distinct advantage that they have large support staff including dedicated physios and massage therapists who can get the player ready for subsequent matches. Besides, the top players have coaches who may have themselves won slams, and thus carry a wealth of experience. Sometimes players also enlist the services of data analysts who can do opponent video/data analysis to determine patterns/preferences of opponents. Such massive support staff carry a lot of payroll that most unseeded players cannot afford. For this reason, though at times we see a qualifier make it through to later stages of a slam, they will rarely ever get past quarter finals let alone win a grand slam."}

You also need to be careful about fried foods, because batters often contain milk or buttermilk. Ask about the ingredients of bread, as these can contain butter: croissants typically do. Even salads can be a concern, because many restaurants will add cheese as a topping, even without listing cheese on the menu. Desserts are also problematic, because chocolate nearly always contains milk, as do most ice creams. Look for vegan products where you can, such as vegan cheeses and vegan ice cream, which can be delicious."}

{"instruction": "Explain in few words how traditional exploratory data analysis (in statistics) is different from machine learning?", "input": "", "output": "An important general difference in the focus and purpose between machine learning and the traditional Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is that machine learning is more oriented towards applications than explaining the basic nature of the underlying phenomena. Machine Learning is relatively less concerned with identifying the specific relations between the involved variables. For example, uncovering the nature of the underlying functions or the specific types of interactive, multivariate dependencies between variables are not the main goal of machine learning. Instead, the focus is on producing a solution that can generate useful predictions. Machine Learning accepts among others a \"black box\" type approach to data exploration or knowledge discovery and uses not only the traditional Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, but also such techniques as Neural Networks which can generate valid predictions but are not capable of identifying the specific nature of the interrelations between the variables on which the predictions are based."}

Yet not nearly enough to deserve Sachin's adoration.\n\nSachin is great in my opinion mostly because of his age when he first entered the cricket scene; to perform what he did at the age of 16 is incredible. Consider yourself at 16...and then consider Imran, Waqar, and Wasim blasting into you at 16 in front of a partisan crowd, with all of India watching. Consider yourself as a 16-year-old fighting the arch-enemy Pakistan. Imagine yourself at the age of 16 being smashed on the body with a leather ball.

The manner he dealt with the top fast bowlers of the day, like as Allan Donald. And his famed war with Shane Warne... these battles, and more, when he faced the opposition, are unique to him; almost.\n\n\nAnd then there's the fact that he's believed to have the purest game with the widest range of shots... To watch him bat is to witness beauty in action, poetry in motion. There is no better sight than Sachin in full flow...\n\nAnd the icing on the cake?\n\nHe has succeeded in all forms of the game.

A quarterback that excels at passing the football and running the football is commonly referred to as a \"dual threat\" quarterback. Individual rushing statistics may also be considered when determining their rankings.

Wahoo system is aimed at what is defined as “time crunched athletes, and uses a 4 dimensional power profile, rather than the FTP (Functional Threshold Power) that other systems use.\n\nZwift is one of the oldest virtual cycling system, and is based on a social experience that allows riders to communicate with others nearby, do group rides, workouts and Races.  Zwift was not the first to introduce many of the virtual riding concepts, but the platform gained thousands of users during the covid-19 pandemic, and capitalised on the professional esports arena as well.\n\nZwift uses a more game-like graphical system, with multiple worlds that users can ride, with a monthly calendar changing the available worlds to ride it.  Zwit also has a comprehensive workout catalog.\n\nRouvy is a cycling platform that contains many of the features already mentioned, but it uses real world videos, with rider avatars superimposed over the top (Augmented Reality).  This gives you the feeling of actually riding the location you have selected, while seeing your vital statistics in the heads-up display.\n\nBKool is another software company offering many of the features that have been described in Zwift and Rouvy.  \n\nFulGaz is a newer platform that offers real video riding in high definition, and allows riders to upload their own videos to the community.\n\nIf you are looking for a riding app that allows you to ride and meet other people, group ride and just enjoy your time on the bike, then Zwift is a good choice to make.  If you are looking for some serious training, with detailed fitness reporting, the Wahoo systems would make a lot of sense.  If you want some serious training, but also want the experience of riding in real locations around the world, the Rouvy is the one to try. \n\nEach system requires a subscription to ride."}

Harry encounters the school's potions master, Severus Snape, who displays a dislike for him; the rich pure-blood Draco Malfoy whom he develops an enmity with; and the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Quirinus Quirrell, who turns out to be allied with Lord Voldemort.

Take a shovel and dig one blade length into the soil and set that to the side. Then dig out a second blade length into the soil and set this portion to the side as well. Put the first portion back into the hole you've dug and then place the second portion on the top. By following this method, you can exchange the subsoil and topsoil. Alternatively, you can build a raised garden bed using wood or other material you have hand like corrugated metal. A raised garden bed should have sides that are about 1 - 3 feet high although you can vary this based on your needs. Fill the garden bed with soil mix from your local garden store or from other areas of your yard. Once the garden bed is filled, you can begin planting. Finally, you can use a sheet mulching method to start a garden bed in your backyard. Take thick cardboard or several sheets of a heavy paper material and lay it down on top of a grassy area in your backyard. You want to make sure that the cardboard or paper is overlapped so that it blocks all light to soil and grass underneath it. Once you have finished laying down your material to block the light, spread compost on top so it is three to six inches deep. You can plant into this compost layer. As a final layer, place one to three inches of mulch or straw on top to protect your compost layer."}

The ace counts as either the highest or lowest, but not both at the same time. (e.g. five, six, seven, eight, nine, all of hearts)\n3) Four-of-a-kind - this hand contains four of the same card (e.g. four tens)\n4) Full house - Three-of-a-kind of the same card, and a pair of a different card. (e.g. three sevens and two jacks)\n5) Flush - Five cards of the same suits (e.g. five spades)\n6) Straight - Five consecutive cards, where the ace can count as either the highest or lowest card, but not both at the same time (e.g. ace, two, three, four, five). \n7) Three-of-a-kind - this hand contains three of the same card (e.g. three sevens)\n8) Two pair - this hand contains two sets of two cards that are the same (e.g. two fives and two queens)\n9) One pair - this hand contains one set of two cards that are the same (e.g. two tens)\n10) High card - this hand contains none of the other options, and just has a high card.\n\nFor all poker hands, if they are of the same ranking, then one has to look at the height of the cards themselves to determine the strongest hand. A full house of three aces and two tens is stronger than a full house of three kings and two tens. At the same time, three kings and two tens beats three tens and two aces, because the kings are stronger."}

His three laws of classical mechanics successfully predicted the behavior of solid bodies across all observable scales - from the motion of planets to falling apples. For over 250 years his laws were applied with greater and greater precision, always giving the correct answers.\n\nHowever, in the late 1800s physicists struggled to reconcile measurements of the speed of light with Newton's laws. This one of the observations that led to Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.\n\nAlbert Einstein (1879-1955) was a German-born physicist who revolutionized our understanding of space, time and matter with his theories of relativity and quantum mechanics. His theories of special and general relativity changed our understanding of space and time and successfully explained the motion of light and the behavior of gravity.  His theories of quantum mechanics likewise revolutionized our understand of the sub-atomic world.\n\nIn addition to Newton and Einstein there are many other physicists who made groundbreaking discoveries,  including Galileo Galilei, James Clerk Maxwell,  Marie Curie, Neils Bohr, Richard Feynman, and Stephen Hawking."}

{"instruction": "Define judicial review and explain John Marshall’s role in establishing judicial review.", "input": "", "output": "Judicial review is a power the courts have to declare that a federal or state law violates the Constitution thereby nullifying the law making it enforceable. Just before President Adams left office he appointed new justices of the peace for Washington D.C., Jefferson, the next President refused to deliver the commissions.  This led to the case Marbury vs Madison.  The basis of the case was that the Judiciary Act of 1789 allowed for the appointed to request a court order to grant their appointments with original jurisdiction given to the Supreme Court. John Marshall saw that siding with Jefferson would make it seem like the Supreme Court was his lackey.  If they sided with Adams, there was no way to make Jefferson enforce the ruling.  Both decisions would reduce the Supreme Court's legitimacy. John Marshall side-stepped this problem by striking down the Judiciary Act on the grounds that it was unconstitutional. This was the establishment of judicial review, a Supreme Court power that was only hinted at in the Constitution."}

{"instruction": "Why do leaves on houseplants turn yellow and brown?", "input": "", "output": "Often houseplant leaves turn yellow and brown for a few common reasons. First is overwatering. Houseplants are kept in containers that can retain water which can lead to root rot if not watered carefully. Some houseplants prefer the soil to dry out between waterings and many home gardeners end up watering before the soil has dried up sufficiently. Too much water in a container can lead to root rot which first can show symptoms in browning, dropping, and yellowing of leaves. Another reason for leaf discoloration is under watering as some plants prefer the soil to have a level of moisture at all times. Other reasons include too little sunlight which limits the plants ability to photosynthesize. Also, even too much sunlight can cause burned leaves."}

{"instruction": "how to swim in ocean", "input": "", "output": "Swimming in the ocean can be an exhilarating experience, but it's important to take proper safety precautions to ensure that you stay safe. Here are some steps to follow to help you swim in the ocean:\n\nChoose a Safe Location: Before entering the water, make sure you choose a safe location to swim. Look for a spot that's away from strong currents, riptides, and waves. Avoid swimming alone, and make sure there are other people around in case you need help.\n\nCheck the Conditions: Before entering the water, check the weather and ocean conditions. Avoid swimming if there are strong winds, high waves, or thunderstorms. If there are lifeguards on duty, ask them about the current conditions and any potential hazards.\n\nWear Proper Gear: Make sure you wear proper swimwear, such as a wetsuit or rash guard, to protect your skin from the sun and ocean elements. Consider wearing fins or a snorkel to help you swim more efficiently.\n\nPractice Good Swimming Technique: When swimming in the ocean, use good swimming technique to help conserve your energy. Avoid swimming against the current, and swim parallel to the shore if you need to move sideways. Use a slow, steady stroke to conserve energy.\n\nBe Aware of Marine Life: When swimming in the ocean, be aware of any marine life that may be in the water. Avoid swimming near schools of fish, and stay away from jellyfish and other potentially dangerous creatures. If you do encounter a shark or other predator, stay calm and swim away slowly.\n\nFollow Ocean Safety Rules: Finally, follow any ocean safety rules that are in place. For example, some beaches may have specific areas designated for swimming, while others may require you to wear a life jacket or avoid swimming during certain times of day.\n\nBy following these steps, you can enjoy a safe and enjoyable swimming experience in the ocean. Remember to stay aware of your surroundings, practice good swimming technique, and take proper safety precautions to ensure that you stay safe."}

{"instruction": "Who is Simon Bolivar?", "input": "", "output": "Simón José Antonio de la Santísima Trinidad Bolívar y Palacios (24 July 1783 – 17 December 1830) was a Venezuelan military and political leader who led what are currently the countries of Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Panama and Bolivia to independence from the Spanish Empire. He is known colloquially as El Libertador, or the Liberator of America.\n\nSimón Bolívar was born in Caracas in the Captaincy General of Venezuela into a wealthy family of American-born Spaniards (criollo), but lost both parents as a child. Bolívar was educated abroad and lived in Spain, as was common for men of upper-class families in his day. While living in Madrid from 1800 to 1802, he was introduced to Enlightenment philosophy and married María Teresa Rodríguez del Toro y Alaysa, who died in Venezuela from yellow fever in 1803. From 1803 to 1805, Bolívar embarked on a Grand Tour that ended in Rome, where he swore to end the Spanish rule in the Americas. In 1807, Bolívar returned to Venezuela and proposed gaining Venezuelan independence to other wealthy creoles. When the Spanish authority in the Americas weakened due to Napoleon's Peninsular War, Bolívar became a zealous combatant and politician in the Spanish American wars of independence.\n\nBolívar began his military career in 1810 as a militia officer in the Venezuelan War of Independence, fighting Royalist forces for the first and second Venezuelan republics and the United Provinces of New Granada. After Spanish forces subdued New Granada in 1815, Bolívar was forced into exile on Jamaica. In Haiti, Bolívar met and befriended Haitian revolutionary leader Alexandre Pétion. After promising to abolish slavery in Spanish America, Bolívar received military support from Pétion and returned to Venezuela. He established a third republic in 1817 and then crossed the Andes to liberate New Granada in 1819. Bolívar and his allies defeated the Spanish in New Granada in 1819, Venezuela and Panama in 1821, Ecuador in 1822, Peru in 1824, and Bolivia in 1825. Venezuela, New Granada, Ecuador, and Panama were merged into the Republic of Colombia (Gran Colombia), with Bolívar as president there and in Peru and Bolivia.\n\nIn his final years, Bolívar became increasingly disillusioned with the South American republics, and distanced from them because of his centralist ideology. He was successively removed from his offices until he resigned the presidency of Colombia and died of tuberculosis in 1830. His legacy is diverse and far-reaching within Latin America and beyond. He is regarded as a national and cultural icon throughout Latin America; the nations of Bolivia and Venezuela (as the Boliviarian Republic of Venezuela) are named after him, and he has been memorialized all over the world in the form of public art or street names and in popular culture."}

{"instruction": "what is entropy", "input": "", "output": "Entropy is a scientific concept, as well as a measurable physical property, that is most commonly associated with a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty. The term and the concept are used in diverse fields, from classical thermodynamics, where it was first recognized, to the microscopic description of nature in statistical physics, and to the principles of information theory. It has found far-ranging applications in chemistry and physics, in biological systems and their relation to life, in cosmology, economics, sociology, weather science, climate change, and information systems including the transmission of information in telecommunication.\n\nThe thermodynamic concept was referred to by Scottish scientist and engineer William Rankine in 1850 with the names thermodynamic function and heat-potential. In 1865, German physicist Rudolf Clausius, one of the leading founders of the field of thermodynamics, defined it as the quotient of an infinitesimal amount of heat to the instantaneous temperature. He initially described it as transformation-content, in German Verwandlungsinhalt, and later coined the term entropy from a Greek word for transformation. Referring to microscopic constitution and structure, in 1862, Clausius interpreted the concept as meaning disgregation.\n\nA consequence of entropy is that certain processes are irreversible or impossible, aside from the requirement of not violating the conservation of energy, the latter being expressed in the first law of thermodynamics. Entropy is central to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease with time, as they always arrive at a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, where the entropy is highest.\n\nAustrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann explained entropy as the measure of the number of possible microscopic arrangements or states of individual atoms and molecules of a system that comply with the macroscopic condition of the system. He thereby introduced the concept of statistical disorder and probability distributions into a new field of thermodynamics, called statistical mechanics, and found the link between the microscopic interactions, which fluctuate about an average configuration, to the macroscopically observable behavior, in form of a simple logarithmic law, with a proportionality constant, the Boltzmann constant, that has become one of the defining universal constants for the modern International System of Units (SI).\n\nIn 1948, Bell Labs scientist Claude Shannon developed similar statistical concepts of measuring microscopic uncertainty and multiplicity to the problem of random losses of information in telecommunication signals. Upon John von Neumann's suggestion, Shannon named this entity of missing information in analogous manner to its use in statistical mechanics as entropy, and gave birth to the field of information theory. This description has been identified as a universal definition of the concept of entropy."}

These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.  If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time."}

{"instruction": "What has been the idea of Atlanticism", "input": "", "output": "Atlanticism, also known as Transatlanticism, is the ideological belief in support for a close relationship between the peoples and governments of the allies to NATO in Northern America (the United States and Canada) and those in Europe (the countries of the European Union, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, etc.) on political, economic, and defense issues to the purpose of maintaining the security and prosperity of the participating countries and protect liberal democracy and the progressive values of an open society that unite them under multiculturalism. The term derives from the Atlantic Ocean, which is bordered by North America and Europe.\n\nThe term can be used in a more specific way to refer to support for North Atlantic military alliances against the Soviet Union, or in a more expansive way to imply broader cooperation, perceived deeply shared values, a merging of diplomatic cultures, as well as a sense of community and some degree of integration between North America and Europe. In practice, the philosophy of Atlanticism encourages active North American, particularly American, engagement in Europe and close cooperation between states on both sides of the ocean. Atlanticism manifested itself most strongly during the Second World War and in its aftermath, the Cold War, through the establishment of various Euro-Atlantic institutions, most importantly NATO and the Marshall Plan.\n\nAtlanticism varies in strength from region to region and from country to country based on a variety of historical and cultural factors. It is often considered to be particularly strong in Eastern Europe, Central Europe, Ireland and the United Kingdom (linked to the Special Relationship). Politically, it has tended to be associated most heavily and enthusiastically but not exclusively with classical liberals or the political right in Europe. Atlanticism often implies an affinity for U.S. political or social culture, or affinity for Europe in North America, as well as the historical bonds between the two continents.\n\nThere is some tension between Atlanticism and continentalism on both sides of the Atlantic, with some people emphasising increased regional cooperation or integration over trans-Atlantic cooperation. The relationship between Atlanticism and North American or European integrations is complex, and they are not seen in direct opposition to one another by many commentators. Internationalism is the foreign policy belief combining both Atlanticism and continentalism."}

{"instruction": "How do you increase your output on a Peloton ride?", "input": "", "output": "If you want to increase your output on a Peloton ride there are definitely a few tips and tricks to follow to ensure progress. First off, I would always recommend using the same official Peloton equipment (Peloton Bike or Peloton Bike+) to ensure you are tracking consistent metrics between your rides. I would also recommend doing a Functional Threshold Power Test (FTP Test), to get a baseline of your maximum performance as well as get a power meter for each of your rides. From there, a big amount of increasing your power comes from consistency of both riding frequency as well as consistency in overloading your leg muscles during those durations. Taking Power Zone rides (PZE, PZ, PZMax) or Power Zone programs is a great way to increase your output over time. These rides/programs are tailored to your max level of effort, and as you progress over time, so will your 7 power zone levels. Besides consistently riding and keeping track of your metrics/FTP, there is a quick trick for increasing your output which is not that sustainable. The trick is to ride out of the saddle and crank the resistance all the way up (75+). If you can move your legs at 50+ cadence and over say an 80 resistance, you will be putting up over 300 output. If you can sustain that for a minute at a time and do that 3-5 times during a ride, you will easily increase your total output. Lower cadence is not ideal for increasing your power from a longevity strategy, but is a quick answer for breaking a personal record. Good luck on your future rides, and don't forget to send love with some highfives!"}
{"instruction": "Who would win if Mike Tyson fought Tyson Fury?", "input": "", "output": "This seems like a tricky question to answer as both boxers have a very different fighting style and belong to different eras. It's easy to say that Tyson Fury would have the reach advantage due to his height being just under 7 feet, but if I had to pick one I would pick Mike Tyson due to the sheer ferocity of his boxing skills. \n\nMike Tyson would probably seek to cause a lot of body damage with his signature hooks to the liver and use Fury's long gait to sneak inwards for body shots. It would be interesting to see how Fury is able to limit the body damage caused by Mike by using his world-renowned reflexes. \n\nI must still say that it would be a very close fight as both of them are greats of the boxing world!"}

How much space do you have to store the boat?  Will the boat be used in fresh or salt water?  Inboard motors are great for fresh water environments.  Outboard motors are often preferable for salt water applications. If you plan on using the boat for fishing, you need to decide if you will be fishing offshore or inshore.  Inshore fishing requires a smaller draft.  Draft is how much water a boat needs to float.  Offshore fishing boats have deeper drafts based on the hull.  Offshore boats can handle rougher water based on more aggressive hulls.  Offshore boats have steeper dead rise.  Dead rise is the angle of entry for the boat hull.  More aggressive dead-rise leas to a softer land in harsh water conditions."}

{"instruction": "What is a plot hole?", "input": "", "output": "A plot hole is a plot point that happens in a fictional story, such as a movie, that contradicts the established logic of the story. For example, if a character is established as being extremely selfish, but in one scene he gives money to another character in need for no apparent reason, this would be a plot hole as this development would not make sense to a reasonable audience member.\n\nMost plot holes can still be explained if someone tries hard enough, but if the story does not give enough clues for an audience member to easily understand what is going on, it is a plot hole.\n\nPlot holes have different effects on different people. Some people are taken out of the story when they notice a plot hole. Others never notice it. Still others notice plot holes or learn of them afterwards, but do not mind the plot holes."}

On 15 February 1942, the British surrendered to Japan and Singapore was renamed to Syonan-to. During the Japanese occupation, over 2500 lives were executed and many suffered hardships.\n\nPost World War II, Singapore operated as a self-government led by Lee Kuan Yew, reducing its reliance on the British. During 1963 to 1965, Singapore had a merger with neighbouring country Malayisa. However, the merger brought about many disagreement, tensions and unrest. Eventually, Singapore separated from Malaysia and became a fully independent country on 9 August 1965."}

{"instruction": "What is the history of the Masters Golf Tournament", "input": "", "output": "The Masters was started by amateur champion Bobby Jones and investment banker Clifford Roberts. After his grand slam in 1930, Jones acquired the former plant nursery and co-designed Augusta National with course architect Alister MacKenzie. First played 89 years ago in 1934, the tournament is an official money event on the PGA Tour, the European Tour, and the Japan Golf Tour. The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless they need to be re-fitted with a new jacket). The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Lee Elder, and Tom Watson. Since 1960, a semi-social contest at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. Tiger Woods won five between 1997 and 2019. Palmer won four between 1958 and 1964. Five have won three titles at Augusta: Jimmy Demaret, Sam Snead, Gary Player, Nick Faldo, and Phil Mickelson. Player, from South Africa, was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in 1961; the second was Seve Ballesteros of Spain, the champion in 1980 and 1983.\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened 90 years ago in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed."}

{"instruction": "What are Uncontacted peoples?", "input": "", "output": "Uncontacted peoples generally refers to indigenous peoples who have remained largely isolated to the present day, maintaining their traditional lifestyles and functioning mostly independently from any political or governmental entities. However, European exploration and colonization during the early modern period brought indigenous peoples worldwide into contact with colonial settlers and explorers. As such, most indigenous groups have had some form of contact with other peoples. The term \"uncontacted\" therefore refers to a lack of sustained contact with the majority of non-indigenous society at the present time.\n\nThe Inter-American Commission on Human Rights refers to uncontacted peoples as \"indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation.\" These groups are defined by their general rejection of contact with anyone outside of their own people. This definition also includes groups who have previously had sustained contact with the majority non-indigenous society but have chosen to return to isolation and no longer maintain contact. As such uncontacted peoples are understood not as living in an anachronistic state of nature but rather as contemporaries of modernity.\n\nA 2009 United Nations report also classified \"peoples in initial contact\" as sharing the same characteristics but beginning to regularly communicate with and integrate into mainstream society.\n\nTo highlight their agency in staying uncontacted or isolated, international organizations emphasize calling them \"indigenous peoples in isolation\" or \"in voluntary isolation\". Otherwise they have also been called \"hidden peoples\" or \"uncontacted tribes\".\n\nHistorically European colonial ideas of uncontacted peoples, and their colonial claims over them, were informed by the imagination of and search for Prester John, king of a wealthy Christian realm in isolation, as well as the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, identifying uncontacted peoples as \"lost tribes\".\n\nInternational organizations have highlighted the importance of protecting indigenous peoples' environment and lands, the importance of protecting them from exploitation or abuse, and the importance of no contact in order to prevent the spread of modern diseases.\n\nHistoric exploitation and abuse at the hands of the majority group have led many governments to give uncontacted people their lands and legal protection. Many indigenous groups live on national forests or protected grounds, such as the Vale do Javari in Brazil or the North Sentinel Island in India.\n\nMuch of the contention over uncontacted peoples has stemmed from governments' desire to extract natural resources. In the 1960s and 1970s, Brazil's federal government attempted to assimilate and integrate native groups living in the Amazon jungle in order to use their lands for farming. Their efforts were met with mixed success and criticism until, in 1987, Brazil created the Department of Isolated Indians inside of FUNAI (Fundação Nacional do Índio), Brazil's Indian Agency. FUNAI was successful in securing protected lands which have allowed certain groups to remain relatively uncontacted until the present day.\n\nA different outcome occurred in Colombia when the Nukak tribe of indigenous people was contacted by an evangelical group. The tribe was receptive to trade and eventually moved in order to have closer contact with settlers. This led to an outbreak of respiratory infections, violent clashes with narco-traffickers, and the death of hundreds of the Nukak, more than half of the tribe. Eventually, the Colombian government forcibly relocated the tribe to a nearby town where they received food and government support but were reported as living in poverty.\n\nThe threats to the Nukak tribe are generally shared by all peoples in isolation, particularly the outside world's desire to exploit their lands. This can include lumbering, ranching and farming, land speculation, oil prospecting and mining, and poaching. For example, then Peruvian President Alan García claimed in 2007 that uncontacted groups were only a \"fabrication of environmentalists bent on halting oil and gas exploration\". As recently as 2016, a Chinese subsidiary mining company in Bolivia ignored signs that they were encroaching on uncontacted tribes, and attempted to cover it up. In addition to commercial pursuits, other people such as missionaries can inadvertently cause great damage.\n\nIt was those threats, combined with attacks on their tribe by illegal cocaine traffickers, that led a group of Acre Indians to make contact with a village in Brazil and subsequently with the federal government in 2014. This behaviour suggests that many tribes are aware of the outside world and choose not to make contact unless motivated by fear or self-interest. Satellite images suggest that some tribes intentionally migrate away from roads or logging operations in order to remain secluded.\n\nIndigenous rights activists have often advocated that indigenous peoples in isolation be left alone, saying that contact will interfere with their right to self-determination as peoples. On the other hand, experience in Brazil suggests isolating peoples might want to have trading relationships and positive social connections with others, but choose isolation out of fear of conflict or exploitation. The Brazilian state organization National Indian Foundation (FUNAI) in collaboration with anthropological experts has chosen to make controlled initial contact with tribes. The organization operates 15 trading posts throughout protected territory where tribes can trade for metal tools and cooking instruments. The organization also steps in to prevent some conflicts and deliver vaccinations. However, FUNAI has been critical of political will in Brazil, reporting that it only received 15% of its requested budget in 2017. In 2018, after consensus among field agents, FUNAI released videos and images of several tribes under their protection. Although the decision was criticized, the director of the Isolated Indian department, Bruno Pereira, responded that \"The more the public knows and the more debate around the issue, the greater the chance of protecting isolated Indians and their lands\". He shared that the organization has been facing mounting political pressure to open up lands to commercial companies. He also justified the photography by explaining that FUNAI was investigating a possible massacre against the Flechieros tribe.\n\nRecognizing the myriad problems with contact, the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2009 and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in 2013 introduced guidelines and recommendations that included a right to choose self-isolation.\n\nThere have been reports of human safaris in India's Andaman Islands and in Peru, where tourism companies attempt to help tourists see uncontacted or recently contacted peoples. This practice is controversial."}

{"instruction": "How do you cook a Texas brisket?", "input": "", "output": "Texas is know as the BBQ capital of the world, and Texas brisket leads the pack. For true Texas brisket all you need is salt, pepper, smoke and time!\n\n1. Purchase a whole packer brisket with both the point and flat muscle included. Prime grade brisket is ideal as it will have more fat marbling, which means more flavor and juiciness. However, choice grade will work fine for most cooks. Plan on 1/2 lb per person.\n\n2. Trim your brisket to remove and hard pieces of fat that will not render in the cooking process. I recommend leaving about 1/4 inch of fat on the point side, and trim off all fat off the flat. Note: the brisket trimming make great fat to mix into burgers!\n\n3. Texas brisket is seasoned only with coarse salt and coarse black pepper. I prefer a 50/50 mix. There are MANY brisket rubs available if you are looking to spice up your brisket from the traditional Texas salt and pepper rub.\n\n4. Use a good quality hardwood lump charcoal in your smoker. I use oak as a base wood with a little bit of hickory mixed in. You can use any smoker that can maintain a consistent temperature of 225-250 degrees. I prefer the Big Green Egg, but there are great smokers available from Weber, Traeger, CampChef and many more.\n\n5. Smoke the brisket at 225 degrees until the internal temperature reaches 165-170 degrees. I then remove the brisket, wrap in butcher paper, and return to the smoker until the internal temperature reaches 202 degrees.\n\n6. When the brisket reaches 202 degrees, remove from the smoker and REST. DO NOT SKIP THE REST. Resting the brisket allows those hot and bubbly juices to settle into the meat. I prefer resting my brisket in a cooler covered in towels for 2 hours, but can rest as long as 4 hours before serving.\n\n7. When you are ready to serve, I separate the two pieces, flat and point.Slice the flat against the grain for maximum tenderness. Cube the point for burnt ends.\n\n8. Serve and enjoy!"}

{"instruction": "Give me an example of a business model with a mission statement.", "input": "", "output": "Mission Statement: \n\nTransform the transportation industry with improved customer experience, efficient operations, and reliable services with cost-effectiveness and minimal environmental impact. \n\nThis will be a good mission statement for Uber as it represents the transportation industry as a whole in which Uber can make an impact. Also, we wanted to be clear about the firm’s north star, which is improved customer experience, efficient and reliable operations with low cost, and minimal environmental impact. \n\nUber’s business model: \n\nValue proposition:  \n\nUber’s value prop is to offer transportation services via internet orderings from the customer. Customers order a transportation service via a mobile-enabled app and get instant or real-time updates about the order status. This significantly differs from the current taxi-cab model, where customers must hire a taxi-cab by waiting in line at the airport or taxi station. The existing taxi hire model has a poor experience for customers and comes with a high cost. \n\nActivities, resources, and capabilities: \n\nThe critical activity for Uber in this business model is to connect the passengers and drivers on a demand basis concerning a location with a computer algorithm and deliver the service over a mobile app for both drivers and passengers. \n\nUber needs computational resources and engineers to build the algorithm. Also, Uber needs to develop capabilities to attract drivers and passengers to its platform for each market, country, and city. \n\nRevenue model: \n\nIn this model, Uber customers will pay per hire, which will include the transportation charge, driver’s labor fees, and the driver’s car maintenance, including fuel and running and maintenance expenses of the car, and a small commission for Uber that will be the revenue for the company. On average per ride, Uber expects to earn a 3% commission for basic taxi-hire service. Top-of-the-line services like Uber-X may earn up to 10% commission. \n\nScope of the enterprise: \n\nThis business model's primary customer segment is millennials with smartphones with internet-enabled services. \n\n \n\nThis business model's horizontal scope can be vastly expanded to different products. Uber can start with a standard taxi-hire service, and for the luxury segment, it can offer Uber-X and Uber-SUV. Uber can also branch to adjacent industries like food delivery with Uber Eats and freight delivery with Uber Freight. \n\n \n\nThe business’s sheer scope is to develop the in-house demand algorithm for connecting drivers and passengers. Uber does not intend to employ drivers. Instead, it will lease/contract the drivers on a per-ride basis and pay the contract cost to the drivers. In contrast, the computational and other IT infrastructure services will be leased/rented on services like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure. This will enable Uber to be agile and move fast in various markets while protecting its intellectual property, the algorithm."}

{"instruction": "Why is skiing a great sport?", "input": "", "output": "Skiing is a fun and enjoyable sport or hobby for many reasons.  For many skiers their first memories of skiing are as a kid with their parents, and brings forward fond childhood memories of snow days, hot chocolate and being outdoors.  But what makes skiing so wonderful is that is blends both individual pursuits and as a group activity.  It is a fun activity to do with a group where all the participants are experiencing the outdoors and the trails together.  At the same time, each skier is dependent on their own skills to get down the trail, thereby providing the individual to have their own challenges and experience while spending time with friends or family.  \n\nSkiing offers the opportunity to enjoy the natural wonders of the mountains and experience breathtaking views.  Every day brings different conditions the skier has to adjust to; visibility, temperature, snow conditions.  These all factor into how the skier is going to ski the terrain, which in-turn provides variety to skiing, even if you are visiting the same mountain and skiing the same trails.  \n\nSkiing is known for having a communal type of culture.  Getting on a chair lift with a stranger can often times lead to great conversations, all be it short ones, the chair lift can be a time to connect with other skiers to learn what trails are offering the best conditions, or what areas of the mountain to avoid.  Skiers often look out for one another on the slopes to ensure others are safe if someone falls.\n\nThe exhilaration of speeding down snow packed trail, with views of the mountains and valleys around you, or through the quite of snow capped trees, enjoying time with friends or family, makes skiing one of the best sports people of all ages can enjoy; from little kids to people in their 60's, 70's and even 80's can still enjoy."}
{"instruction": "What should I do to maximize my chances of getting into a top business school?", "input": "", "output": "There are many controllable factors that can help improve your chances of attending a top business school such as Harvard, Stanford, or Wharton.  Four of the most important include:\n- Track record of impactful work experience\n- Strong letters of recommendation from your supervisors\n- Excellent GMAT score and, to a lesser extent, GPA\n- Compelling essays \n\nWork experience is often cited as the most important factor for business school admissions.  Candidates should look for jobs that involve building best-in-class business skills (such as working at Goldman Sachs or McKinsey) or involve leading large groups of people to accomplish important and challenging projects.  One piece of advice is to look at the resumes of successful applicants and see what types of roles they had pre-MBA.\n\nIn addition to having excellent work experience on your resume, it is equally important to have a track record of success at those jobs.  To evaluate track record of strong work performance, business schools require 2-3 letters of recommendations.  It is critical for these recommendations to be highly positive, and any lack of enthusiasm can be an instant red flag for admissions officers.\n\nIn terms of quantitative factors, Harvard, Stanford and Wharton have high average GMAT scores.  Harvard's median GMAT score, for example, was 730 out of 800 for the class of 2024.  Be sure to invest time in preparing for the GMAT, as candidates can significantly increase scores through consistent and dedicated practice.\n\nAdditionally, the essays candidates submit are very important.  The goal of a business school admissions officer to is find candidates who are likely to reach senior executive leadership or other impactful roles in society.  Your essay would ideally reflect a) an aspirational but attainable goal to reach a high impact position, and b) a clear path to get from where you currently are to your long-term goals, including a logical short-term goal immediate post-business school.\n\nSome candidates opt to hire an MBA admissions consultant, which typically costs between $2000-3000 per application.  Consider whether an MBA admissions consultant would be valuable for your process, and if so, be sure to evaluate several by having free upfront consultations."}

During the build-up to depart Tanith, aChaos fleet that splintered off the main force of the coreward sector descended on the world.  Without a strong planetary defense and no time to prepare, Gaunt decided to save what soldiers he could for the imperium instead of fighting.  As chaos began attacking the planet, Gaunt organized the emergency launch of available Tanith troopers.  When all was complete, only a single strength regiment was able to get off the planet.  Tanith itself was destroyed by  the forces of Chaos from orbit and Trooper Larkin, a sniper in the regiment, dubbed the regiment 'ghosts'.  The resulting moniker of Gaunt's Ghosts was used by the men of Tanith and those who ultimately became close to Gaunt himself and the regiment."}

This drill helps with developing shooting with both your right and left hand.  This will help when you begin shooting layups.  Gradually, start taking shots a little farther away from the basket.  Only move backwards when you consistently shoot a high percentage  of made shots.  Finally, you want to focus with movement without the ball.  This includes proper cuts when you are an offensive player without possession of the ball.  You also want to practice proper positioning on defense.  Practice good defensive positioning when you guard the person with and without the ball."}
{"instruction": "What does this mean: \"Steady-state theory\"?", "input": "", "output": "In cosmology, the steady-state model, or steady state theory, is an alternative to the Big Bang theory of the evolution of the universe. In the steady-state model, the density of matter in an expanding universe stays the same because matter is always being made. This fits with the perfect cosmological principle, which says that the universe we can see is pretty much the same everywhere and at any time. \n\nProblems with the steady-state model began to emerge in the 1950s and 60s, when observations began to support the idea that the universe was in fact changing: bright radio sources (quasars and radio galaxies) were found only at large distances (therefore could have existed only in the distant past due to the effects of the speed of light on astronomy), not in closer galaxies. \n\nThe discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964, which the Big Bang theory had predicted, provided the majority of cosmologists with a conclusive challenge to the steady-state model."}

{"instruction": "What is \"woke\" and why is it so controversial?", "input": "", "output": "Woke is a general political term used to group a set of similar ideologies in an attempt to characterize the political motivations typically ascribed to the far left. Although many definitions of woke exist, these definitions run along a few common threads. Woke is typically used to describe the ideals underpinning what is known as equality of outcome. This is to be contrasted with the opposing political forces who support equality of opportunity.\n\nThose who engage in wokeness more often than not cite disparities as evidence of systemic biases or expressions of racism, sexism, classism, genderism, agism and other prejudices. A common example would be that females are disproportionately represented in elementary school teaching whereas males are disproportionately represented in railroad construction. Woke politics would lead us to believe that this is evidence of sexism: women and men are socialized differently so they are pushed into different positions by institutions. Woke opponents would lead us to believe this is evidence of inate preferences different between the sexes: males are generally stronger than females, so men are more suited to performing heavy labor.\n\nWokeness is controversial because its opponents do not believe disparity is evidence of bias. Disparities can exist due to natural or cultural differences, neither of which can be governed out of existence. The opponents of woke ideology also proclaim that it ignores the root cause of problems which plague society. If one's analysis stops at disparity and from disparity an answer is assumed, one can miss the nuances present in a situation. A common unavoidable disparity cited is that 100% of births are to females, but this is not sexism. Analysis past disparity is required to prove or disprove systemic or individual bias."}

American football, also known as gridiron, was first played in 1869 in the United States and mostly known in the United States and Canada. It rivals two teams on a rectangular field. Both teams have an offence as well as a defence formation. The first offence and defence of the match is decided by coin tossed where the winner decide for the first half of the match while the opposite match starts at the half-time mark. The offence team tries to take the oval-shaped ball to the other side of the field by passing or running it at each play. The defence team blocks the offence team so they get the balls themselves either by steeling it or when the offence team hasn’t progressed 10 yards in 4 plays. Then, offence team becomes defence and vice versa. When the offence team successfully reach the 10-yard lines, they obtain a new set of 4 plays to get to the endzone, where they obtain points when succeeding, called a touchdown. They also get points from kicking the ball within the goalpost. The winning team is the one with the most points at the end of the game. European football, also known as soccer, is a match between two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field, known as pitch. Players primarily use their feet to propel a sphere-shaped ball across the field into the rectangular shaped goal guarded by a goalkeeper. The goalkeeper is the only player of each team that can use his hands and arms on the ball within a specific region of the field close to their goals. The game is played continuously until a fault is committed or the ball exits the field. Each team tried and kick the ball in the goal to get points and the winner is the team with the most point at the end of the match."}

This is where non-cumulative inequalities, manifested by multiple groups that each have strengths and weaknesses, fight for political power.  Groups form to represent constituencies, where leaders are elected and engage in compromise decision-making within their group and with leaders of other groups. Groups with opposing interests prevent the accumulation of power with one group.\nCritics of this theory argue that Dahl only talked about policy decisions that were openly debated.  There is a private or hidden power struggle where it is decided whether or not to consider policy at all. Second, that there are cumulative inequalities where those with a low level of resources are not able to mobilize and represent their own interests. Lastly, a group's leadership does not always represent the rank and file membership of the group as a whole."}

{"instruction": "Is it better to invest in the stock market or to keep money in a savings account?", "input": "", "output": "There are key differences between investing in the stock market versus keeping money in a savings account. Savings accounts can be FDIC insured up to $250k (although there are services that can increase this limit such as Wealthfront) and thus are extremely safe places to store money, but these accounts generally have very low interest rates and thus the money will not grow quickly (or at all, compared to inflation). Generally it is recommended to keep an emergency fund available in savings accounts as they may need to be quickly accessible. \n\nThe stock market works differently - you are purchasing shares of a company, and ideally that company grows over time, thus increasing the value of the underlying stocks. People generally invest in the stock market in order to grow their money over time, although it is recommended to measure the success or failure of investments over a long time period (greater than 10 years). The broader US stock market has historically grown nearly 10%/year on average, although many years significantly deviate from that growth rate."}

Food is critical to human survival, and nutritious food is a prerequisite for creating and maintaining a healthy human body and mind. Consuming the wrong kinds of foods can wreak havoc on human metabolism, and over time, lead to hormonal disorders, obesity, diabetes and heart disease. The world is witness to increased cases of such disorders since the time of the industrialisation of the food and pharmaceutical industries. After World War 2, since the 1970s, the rates of incidence of the aforementioned diseases have increased manifold, correlated strongly with the increased consumption of processed foods, seed oils, sugar and carbohydrates while being negatively correlated with the consumption of saturated fats and red meat. Thus, while the average life expectancy of human beings has increased, albeit differently for different regions of the world, with the increasing contribution of modern medical practice, the quality of life for most people has decreased. The case can be made that we, as a society, are becoming calorie-rich but nutrient-poor, with negative outcomes for public health."}

It has been held at the All England Club in Wimbledon, London, since 1877 and is played on outdoor grass courts, with retractable roofs over the two main courts since 2019.\n\nWimbledon is one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments, the others being the Australian Open, the French Open, and the US Open. Wimbledon is the only major still played on grass, the traditional tennis playing surface. Also, it is the only Grand Slam that retains a night-time curfew, though matches can now continue until 11.00 pm under the lights.\n\nThe tournament traditionally takes place over two weeks in late June and early July, starting on the last Monday in June and culminating with the Ladies' and Gentlemen's Singles Finals, scheduled for the Saturday and Sunday at the end of the second week. Five major events are held each year, with additional junior and invitational competitions also taking place. In 2009, Wimbledon's Centre Court was fitted with a retractable roof to lessen the loss of playing time due to rain. A roof was operational over No. 1 Court from 2019, when a number of other improvements were made, including adding cushioned seating, a table and 10 independently operable cameras per court to capture the games.\n\nWimbledon traditions include a strict all-white dress code for competitors, and royal patronage. Strawberries and cream are traditionally consumed at the tournament. Unlike other tournaments, advertising is minimal and low key from official suppliers such as Slazenger and Rolex. The relationship with Slazenger is the world's longest-running sporting sponsorship, providing balls for the tournament since 1902.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 Wimbledon was cancelled, the first cancellation of the tournament since World War II. The rescheduled 134th edition was staged from 28 June 2021 to 11 July 2021, following from the 2020 cancellation. The 135th edition was played between 27 June 2022 and 10 July 2022, and regularly scheduled play occurred on the middle Sunday for the first time. It marks the centenary of the inaugural championships staged at the Centre Court. The ATP, ITF, and WTA did not award ranking points for the 2022 tournament, due to controversy over the tournament excluding players representing Russia and Belarus.\n\nThe 2023 Wimbledon Championships will be the 136th staging and will run from 3 July 2023 to 16 July 2023 and it will be the first event of King Charles III since the death of the former patron, Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September 2022."}

Graduation being his first stadium album that really skyrocketed Kanye into the mainstream resulting in sold out tours and solidifying pop culture relevance. The fundamentalists fight for The College Dropout as it is a reflection of a simpler time and arguably his most honest and well produced album to date. The construction of this album was the subject of the Netflix 2022 documentary Jeen-yus.\n\nAt the end of the day, there is no right or wrong answer. Every person has a Kanye album that is their GOAT as it were. One cannot answer this question objectively. Such is life and the question itself reflects that journey so beautifully. Kanye albums are things you feel deep within your heart and resonate with you for a lifetime."}

{"instruction": "Based on this information that I have shared about Abel Janszoon Tasman, can you summarize it for me?", "input": "", "output": "Sure, here is summary about Abel Janszoon Tasman:\n\nAbel Janszoon Tasman (Dutch: [ˈɑbəl ˈjɑnsoːn ˈtɑsmɑn]; 1603 – 10 October 1659) was a Dutch seafarer and explorer best known for his voyages of 1642 and 1644 in the service of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). He was appointed by the VOC to explore the uncharted regions of the Southern Pacific Ocean and discovered Van Diemen's Land, Staten Landt, and Nieuw Zeeland. Despite his achievements, his expedition was not entirely successful due to a violent confrontation with the Māori people on the South Island of New Zealand. Nonetheless, his expedition paved the way for further exploration and colonization of Australia and New Zealand by the Europeans. Abel Tasman was born around 1603 in Lutjegast, a small village in the province of Groningen, in the north of the Netherlands.\n\nHe served the Dutch East India Company until his death in 1659, leaving behind a legacy as one of the greatest explorers of his time. He was engaged to marry 21-year-old Jannetje Tjaers, of Palmstraat in the Jordaan district of the city, and took part in a voyage to Seram Island. He was second-in-command of a 1639 expedition of exploration into the north Pacific under Matthijs Quast, which reached Fort Zeelandia and Deshima.\n\nThe Council of the Indies dispatched Tasman and Franchoijs Jacobszoon Visscher on a voyage to explore the Provinces of Beach, which had appeared on European maps since the 15th century. Tasman attempted to land in North Bay, but the sea was too rough, so he turned away and continued his continent-hunting.\nTasman and his crew sighted land on the north-west coast of New Zealand, naming it Staten Landt in honour of the States General. Tasman's expedition encountered a group of Māori who attacked four sailors and named the area \"Murderers' Bay\".\n\nTasman's second voyage was a disappointment for the Dutch East India Company, who decided that a more persistent explorer should be chosen for future expeditions. Tasman's voyage in 1642-43 proved that the small fifth continent was not joined to any larger sixth continent, and his suggestion that New Zealand was the western side of that Southern Continent was seized upon by European cartographers.\n\nTasmanians have named places after him, including the Tasman Peninsula, Tasman Highway, Tasman Glacier, Tasman Lake, Mount Tasman, and Abel Tasman Monument."}

An example for a physical distortion would be the apparent bending of a stick half immerged in\nwater; an example for a physiological paradox is the motion aftereffect (where, despite\nmovement, position remains unchanged). \n4. An example for a physiological fiction is an afterimage\n5. Three cognitive distortions are the  Ponzo , Poggendorff, and Müller-Lyer illusion.\n6. Physical illusions are caused by the physical environment, e.g. by the optical properties of\nwater. Physiological illusions arise in the eye or the visual pathway.\n7.

GIS and geovisualization allow for more interactive maps; including the ability to explore different layers of the map, to zoom in or out, and to change the visual appearance of the map, usually on a computer display. Geovisualization represents a set of cartographic technologies and practices that take advantage of the ability of modern microprocessors to render changes to a map in real time, allowing users to adjust the mapped data on the fly."}

The weather is mild all throughout the winter, so you won't need to scrape snow and ice off of your car every day, although there have been a number of snow storms in the last couple years but they quickly melt and only last a day or two at a time. The summers get hot and can stay above 100 degrees Fahrenheit for weeks at a time. This may sound like a negative, but one of the best things about Austin is the access to water. Lady Bird Lake, sometimes called Town Lake, is actually a river that runs through the middle of the city. Paddle boarding, swimming in Barton Springs, and party boats on Lake Travis are all water related activities that are particularly fun for a young demographic. There is a vibrant music scene with many local bands and plenty of art related communities. The conscious community in Austin is growing as well through many different types of activities like ecstatic dance, authentic relating, and tantra. There is something for everyone in Austin. The city is a tourist destination with many bachelor and bachelorette parties choosing to visit. Austin also hosts SXSW and ACL, both of which draw many hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. The people are friendly, similar to Minneapolis. The tech scene feels a bit like the New York City hustle, while the West coast chill is present through the laid back, fun oriented lifestyle. You can find whatever you're looking for here, and it is worth spending time here to see how you can make the city your own."}

When added to food or even drinks, salt enhances the flavors of other ingredients and helps amplify subtle flavors that may otherwise be lost.

Cooks have a choice of a variety of types of salt.

Regardless of the type of salt, common table salt is chemically sodium chloride, or NaCl."}

A technical expert, in-house or vendor, considers it an engineering problem, while a business user needs it to have a business impact.  Multiple frameworks can help build consensus.  However, an ideal approach will go through these steps.\n1. Identify a business outcome.  This is a very high-level outcome that is industry aligned and has no technical description.  An example from the healthcare industry is a 'better patient experience.'\n2. List strategies defined by an organisation to deliver these outcomes.  To our example in step 1, one approach is reducing patient wait time when attending a hospital.'\n3. Clarify the KPIs and measurements listed in these strategies.  In this example, it can be 'Max patient wait time of 20 mins'. \n4. List business capabilities that can deliver results towards these KPIs.  Here we can think of ways patients can register their details electronically on their own or hospital devices vs paper forms.  Each entry will initiate an automated process to assign the right staff and resources to address patient needs.\n5. Build technical capabilities that will deliver above listed business capabilities.  An online form integrated with AI Bot service and workflow automation can reduce time and manual intervention.\n\nThese technical capabilities that deliver a business capability towards a business outcome should be considered a 'Business Use Case'."}

{"instruction": "What are the most important tools to own when I am an apartment renter?", "input": "", "output": "As a renter, you’ll often find yourself hanging pictures, assembling furniture, installing floating shelves, opening and cutting up boxes, storing things on high shelves, tightening screws or bolts that come loose over time, cleaning cobwebs, measuring furniture or a room where you’d like to put furniture, unclogging a toilet, or any number of other activities centered around daily apartment life. \n\nTo do these things, you’ll need a small number of tools, including:\n- A standard toilet plunger, because toilets get clogged. Get this most important tool first.\n- A 1” wide tape measure. Get one that’s 25ft long. The wide width makes it easier for one person to measure long runs or furniture by themselves. A 25ft length will be long enough to measure the longest wall of most rooms and any piece of furniture.\n- A small level to evenly hang pictures and anything else you can think of. It should be about 10” to 12” long.\n- A pair of #2 Phillips head and #2 flat tip screwdrivers. Or, a ratcheting screwdriver with a set of replaceable screwdriver tips. To tighten loose screws or assemble furniture.\n- A folding step-stool that has two or three steps, and can support two to three hundred pounds. To quickly and safely reach those high shelves, hang pictures, and get close to things that are too high off the ground for you to reach standing in your flat shoes.\n- A comfortable-in-hand hammer, to drive nails for hanging pictures, gently tap things together, or break things apart. A wooden handled, curved-claw hammer that weighs between 12oz-16oz will serve most users well. When pulling nails, place a thin piece of wood between the hammerhead and delicate surfaces such as sheetrock to avoid damaged. Good hardware stores carry both.\n- A pair of adjustable wrenches for tightening just about anything. You’ll often need a pair of\nwrenches to both hold and tighten the same fastener. A smaller 8” and larger 10” adjustable\nwrenches make a good combination for most tasks.\n- A utility knife and a package of quality blades. To safely cut open boxes and other packaging, as well as trim paper, fabrics, textiles, wood…etc. The knife should feel secure in your hand and have a large, easy to turn knob to open the knife to change blades. Buy a package of high-quality name brand replacement blades to keep on hand.\n- An extra power receptacle for an emergency or unplanned usage. Always have an extra on\nhand…you will need it.\n- Hex wrenches. Also called Allen keys. You’ll need these mainly for assembling things like\nfurniture. These come in both metric and imperial standard sizes. Both are useful to have, but if you only buy one set, make it metric, as it’s the most common type of fastener used to assemble furniture.\n- A stud finder. Stud finders help you locate the wall studs hidden behind the sheetrock. You’ll need to know where the wall studs are in order to know which fasteners you can use.\n- A tool box or bag. The only rule here is that the bag needs to hold all of your tools. So, you should probably buy this after you’ve owned and used a few of the tools listed previously, and have a better idea how you’d like to store them, carry them and access them.\n- A cordless drill and impact driver set, if you can afford it. All the other tools are more important, but these two tools are incredibly useful and make many jobs go faster and more pleasantly. The drill is for drilling. The impact driver is for driving or removing screws and other common fasteners. They look similar, but they are 2 different tools, each giving the user the right kinds of power and feedback required for the job each is designed for. It pays to buy quality here, so buy the best you can afford."}

They don't know how to do basic things around the house like boil an egg, cook rice or pick up after themselves. A telltale sign of a mama's boy: he comes home with a new purchase, opens it up, leaves all the plastic packaging lying around on the kitchen table. It doesn't bother him. He literally does not see the trash he leaves around. Mama's boys don't know how to pay their bills, manage their checking accounts, do grocery shopping and many, many more things. But these behaviors are symbolic of a much deeper deficiency: their emotional intelligence is practically nonexistent. Typically, it takes decades to train a mama's boy to be a fully functioning adult who can be an acceptable partner. It's possible only if he's willing to admit his faults and try every day to be a better human being."}

Additional factors to consider are whether you have a preferred method of transportation and how much time you are willing to spend on this trip. Cheaper transportation options may take a longer time. \n\nThe methods of transportation include airplanes, trains, ships or ferries, busses, and cars, but not all locations have all these transportation methods available.\n\nUsually, if the two places are relatively close to each other, a bus or a train may be a good option. If public transportation between these two places is not well established, then a personal car may be a reasonable alternative.\n\nIn some circumstances, when the distance between the two place is very short, less than three miles or so, walking may be your best option. This, of course, depends on your ability and willingness to walk that distance.\n\nIf the two places are relatively far, usually more than a couple hundred miles, an airplane may be a good option to consider."}

There are no right ways to start a relationship, but a wrong relationship can be harmful to both sides. Therefore, you should take your take and never rush into a new relationship. Some tips for finding a BF or GF:\n1. Participate in more events to meet new people. For example, exercise classes, clubs of your hobby, volunteering, and parties can be a good start.\n2. Ask your friends to recommend some guy/girl they know. Friends can be a reliable source since they share similar background and experience with you.\n3. Be nice, honest and helpful to everyone you meet. This can help you to build good reputation in your friends circle so that people are more likely to be attracted by you.\n4. Know a person well before you start developing a romantic relationship with him/her. Some people may be very different as a friend vs. in a relationship.

Explain to me in a casual tone", "input": "", "output": "Nihilism is a belief that life is ultimately meaningless. Sounds pretty depressing right? Well, there are a number of reasons why one might feel this way. Do you ever feel like you are just going through the motions each day? You wake up, go to work, get off work, sleep, and the cycle continues. You chased after a goal, such as graduating college or getting that next promotion, thinking it would solve all your problems, only to be disappointed after finally getting it. Then you look around the universe that you lives in and find how insignificant your individuality is in the grand schemes of things, you can't help but think to yourself: man, is there any point to life? Does what I do actually matter at all, especially if I'm going to die anyways? \n\nIf you ever feel this way, know that you are not alone. Many, many philosophers throughout human history have pondered upon this very idea. I'll present a select few philosophers and their proposals to fight against nihilism.\n\nOne obvious solution, per Danish philosophers Kierkegaard, is religion. He believes that faith should be our purpose in life, following Him and doing good in this life will reap rewards in the afterlife. \n\nNow, German philosopher Nietzsche does not agree with that at all; in fact his most famous quote was \"God is dead and we killed him\". He's talking about how with new advances in science comes the death of religion -- each man must now create his own values and become an ubermensch. The idea of ubermensch, however, kind of throws morality out of window — who is to say one’s value is wrong?\n\nEnter Albert Camus and his idea of absurdism. He compares human life to Sisyphus — rolling a giant rock uphill, only for the rock to fall back down after reaching the top — an absurd and meaningless struggle. He suggests that we accept the absurdity of this world and human existence, and instead embrace the present, because “The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy”.\n\nAnd there you have it, what nihilism is all about, why it happens and a few ways to fight against it. Note that this is a very extensive topic and what I covered here is only the tip of the iceberg, I’d suggest reading up more if you're interested. Hope it helped!"}

{"instruction": "What is a mitochondrion?", "input": "", "output": "A mitochondrion is an organelle found in the cells of most eukaryotes, such as animals, plants and fungi. Mitochondria have a double membrane structure and use aerobic respiration to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used throughout the cell as a source of chemical energy. They were discovered by Albert von Kölliker in 1857  in the voluntary muscles of insects. The term mitochondrion was coined by Carl Benda in 1898. The mitochondrion is popularly nicknamed the \"powerhouse of the cell\", a phrase coined by Philip Siekevitz in a 1957 article of the same name.\n\nSome cells in some multicellular organisms lack mitochondria (for example, mature mammalian red blood cells). A large number of unicellular organisms, such as microsporidia, parabasalids and diplomonads, have reduced or transformed their mitochondria into other structures. One eukaryote, Monocercomonoides, is known to have completely lost its mitochondria, and one multicellular organism, Henneguya salminicola, is known to have retained mitochondrion-related organelles in association with a complete loss of their mitochondrial genome.\n\nMitochondria are commonly between 0.75 and 3 μm2 in cross section, but vary considerably in size and structure. Unless specifically stained, they are not visible. In addition to supplying cellular energy, mitochondria are involved in other tasks, such as signaling, cellular differentiation, and cell death, as well as maintaining control of the cell cycle and cell growth. Mitochondrial biogenesis is in turn temporally coordinated with these cellular processes. Mitochondria have been implicated in several human disorders and conditions, such as mitochondrial diseases, cardiac dysfunction, heart failure and autism.\n\nThe number of mitochondria in a cell can vary widely by organism, tissue, and cell type. A mature red blood cell has no mitochondria, whereas a liver cell can have more than 2000. The mitochondrion is composed of compartments that carry out specialized functions. These compartments or regions include the outer membrane, intermembrane space, inner membrane, cristae, and matrix.\n\nAlthough most of a eukaryotic cell's DNA is contained in the cell nucleus, the mitochondrion has its own genome (\"mitogenome\") that is substantially similar to bacterial genomes. This finding has led to general acceptance of the endosymbiotic hypothesis - that free-living prokaryotic ancestors of modern mitochondria permanently fused with eukaryotic cells in the distant past, evolving such that modern animals, plants, fungi, and other eukaryotes are able to respire to generate cellular energy."}

{"instruction": "What are important elements to consider when putting together a team to execute your operating model for AI?", "input": "", "output": "When building the right team to execute on your operating model for AI it is key to take into account the following elements:\n\n1) How mature is my data foundation: Whether your data is still in silos, stuck in proprietary formats or difficult to access in a unified way will have big implications on the amount of data engineering work and data platform expertise that is required.\n\n2) Infrastructure and platform administration: Whether you need to maintain or leverage as a service offerings can have a huge impact on your overall team composition. Moreover, if your Data and AI platform is made up of multiple services and components the administrative burden of governing and securing data and users and keeping all parts working together can be overwhelming especially at enterprise scale.\n\n3) MLOps: To make the most of AI you need to be able to use it to impact your business. Hiring a full data science team without having the right ML engineering expertise or the right tools to package, test, deploy and monitor is extremely wasteful. There are several steps that go into running effective end-to-end AI applications and your operating model should reflect that in the roles that are involved and in the way model lifecycle management is executed from use case identification, to development to deployment, and perhaps most importantly utilisation.  \n\nThese three dimensions should inform your focus and the roles that should be part of your development team. Over time, the prevalence of certain roles might shift as your organisation matures along these dimensions and on the platform decisions that you make."}

{"instruction": "How would you describe the differences between Indian and Western music, especially as it relates to the sense of pitch?", "input": "", "output": "Indian and Western music differ considerably in terms of pitch because Western music adheres to the concept of absolute pitch, while Indian music predominantly focuses on relative pitch. Absolute pitch means that a note is represented as an absolute frequency, so if someone says \"A2\", that pitch can be mapped back to an exact frequency, and therefore can be reconciled among many different styles of music and instrumentation. \n\nIn contrast, much of Indian music (both classical and non-classical) uses the concept of relative pitch, which means that the musician sets a tonic note (their base note) and that pitch is the starting point for all other notes. For example, if one musician were to say that a specific pitch were \"sa\" (one of the 7 notes in the Indian music scale), another musician would not be able to reproduce that note, since they wouldn't know where the first musician set their tonic. However, this has other advantages,  because a tune is defined in terms of relative pitch and can be reproduced easily among different musicians and instruments without the worry of an absolute frequency which cannot be reached by a specific musical range."}

{"instruction": "How can I change a bad habit?", "input": "", "output": "Each habit has a trigger event, an action you subconsciously take after the trigger event happens, and the reward that make you keep following the same habit. When you say a habit is bad, it actually means the action you take after the trigger event is something you do not want to keep doing.\n\nAn effective way to make changes is to replace the action to something different. To make this alternative action effective, this action will need to also produce the reward that your brain is seeking for. \n\nIn order to find an effective alternative action, you will need to understand what is your trigger and what is the reward. \n\nFiguring out the trigger is the first step. You can try to think about what happened when you started to take actions. One way to find the pattern is to write down what happened. Then, you can look at them to find the pattern. \n\nOnce you find out the trigger, you can try to remind you to change your action after experiencing the trigger event. With your changed action, you will be able to gradually figure out the reward hidden in your old habit. Some actions will not give you the satisfying feeling like old time. After some try-and-error, you can likely tell the new action that actually gives you the same satisfying feeling. Then, you can keep following the new action. Essentially, this new action helps you form the new habit, which suppress the old habit. \n\nFinally, please note that when you are having extra stress, you may find it is harder to follow the new habit and start to worry about picking up the old habit again. Please trust yourself to keep the new habit. You faith will help you push through difficult situations."}

The insurance transaction involves the policyholder assuming a guaranteed, known, and relatively small loss in the form of a payment to the insurer (a premium) in exchange for the insurer's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss. The loss may or may not be financial, but it must be reducible to financial terms.

Similarly during inflation as Fed tries to control inflation by raising interest rates it has the inverse effect on bond prices. It is important to note that not all bonds react the same way to interest rates. For example, short term interest rate bonds may feel the impact almost immediately while long term bonds may have a gradual but likely to see more impactful price change. It is important to note that there are Treasury Inflation protected securities, a type of a bond that adjust principal value of the bond based on inflation."}

{"instruction": "What happened on September 11, 2001?", "input": "", "output": "The September 11 attacks, commonly known as 9/11, were four coordinated suicide terrorist attacks carried out by the militant Islamist extremist network al-Qaeda against the United States on September 11, 2001. That morning, nineteen terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners scheduled to travel from the East Coast to California. The hijackers crashed the first two planes into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City and the third into the Pentagon (the headquarters of the United States military) in Arlington County, Virginia, near Washington, D.C. The fourth plane was similarly intended to hit a federal government building in D.C., but crashed in a field following a passenger revolt. The attacks killed nearly 3,000 people and instigated the global war on terror.\n\nThe first impact was that of American Airlines Flight 11. It was crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan at 8:46 a.m. Seventeen minutes later, at 9:03, the World Trade Center's South Tower was hit by United Airlines Flight 175. Both 110-story skyscrapers collapsed within an hour and forty-one minutes, bringing about the destruction of the remaining five structures in the WTC complex, as well as damaging or destroying various other buildings surrounding the towers. A third flight, American Airlines Flight 77, crashed into the Pentagon at 9:37 a.m., causing a partial collapse. The fourth and final flight, United Airlines Flight 93, flew in the direction of Washington, D.C. Alerted to the previous attacks, the plane's passengers attempted to gain control of the aircraft, but the hijackers ultimately crashed the plane in a field in Stonycreek Township, Pennsylvania, near Shanksville at 10:03 a.m. Investigators determined that Flight 93 target was either the United States Capitol or the White House.\n\nWithin hours of the attacks, the Central Intelligence Agency determined that al-Qaeda was responsible. The United States formally responded by launching the war on terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, which had not complied with U.S. demands to expel al-Qaeda from Afghanistan and extradite its leader, Osama bin Laden. The U.S.'s invocation of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty—its only usage to date—called upon allies to fight al-Qaeda. As U.S. and NATO ground forces swept through Afghanistan, bin Laden fled to the White Mountains, where he narrowly avoided capture by U.S.-led forces. Although bin Laden initially denied any involvement, in 2004 he formally claimed responsibility for the attacks. Al-Qaeda's cited motivations included U.S. support of Israel, the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, and sanctions against Iraq. After evading capture for almost a decade, bin Laden was killed by the U.S. military on May 2, 2011. U.S. and NATO troops remained in Afghanistan until 2021.\n\nThe attacks resulted in 2,977 non-hijacker fatalities, an indeterminate number of injuries, and substantial long-term health consequences, in addition to at least $10 billion in infrastructure and property damage. It remains the deadliest terrorist attack in human history as well as the single deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers in U.S. history, with 340 and 72 killed, respectively. The destruction of the World Trade Center and its environs seriously harmed the New York City economy and induced global market shocks. Many other countries strengthened anti-terrorism legislation and expanded their powers of law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Cleanup of the World Trade Center site (colloquially \"Ground Zero\") took eight months and was completed in May 2002, while the Pentagon was repaired within a year. After delays in the design of a replacement complex, the One World Trade Center began construction in November 2006 and opened in November 2014. Memorials to the attacks include the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York City, the Pentagon Memorial in Arlington County, Virginia, and the Flight 93 National Memorial at the Pennsylvania crash site."}

In other words, initially, GC operations take up a small fraction of the JVM time, while later, they take up almost all of its time.\n3. GC operations in this second period result in a very slight decrease in the total memory size and the PSYoungGen, ParOldGen, and Metaspace memory areas.

Anyone at any age can attend a ballet class, and can create his or her own piece of ballet dance. \n\nMany people say Ballet is an intensive sport, because one often gets very sweaty after taking a ballet class. It is true that ballet is a good exercise for anyone who takes the class or performs on a stage.

Prior to the Dead, most singers and bands had short three to four minute songs, that were crisp but didn't allow for the musicians in the band to take risks.  They were just playing from the songbook and the notes written down.  The Dead allowed for a more fluid approach, and provided the musicians with opportunities to go off script, and just play for the love of creating music.    The Jam genre they created led to many other bands performing in a similar style and openness, including Phish, Dave Matthews band, Widespread Panic, Blues Travelers and many more.  The Dead(as they are often called) started the trend though, and will be forever memorialized because of that."}

{"instruction": "Can you please explain the offside rule in Soccer?", "input": "", "output": "Soccer is a sport played between two teams with 11 players each.

A player is in an offside position if they are closer to the opposition's goal line than the last defender of the opposition team. \n\nThe law states that a player is in an offside position if any of their body parts, except the hands and arms, are in the opponents' half of the pitch, and closer to the opponents' goal line than both the ball and the second-last defender.\n\nBeing in an offside position is not an offence in itself, but a player so positioned when the ball is played by a teammate can be judged guilty of an offside offence if they receive the ball or will otherwise become \"involved in active play\", will \"interfere with an opponent\", or will \"gain an advantage\" by being in that position. Offside is often considered one of the most difficult to understand aspects of the sport."}

{"instruction": "How do you get your pilot's license?", "input": "", "output": "Learning to fly an airplane is a fun and rewarding endeavor.  There are many different reasons that people decide to pursue getting their pilot's license including the challenge of learning a new skill, having the ability to travel by private plane for business or pleasure, sightseeing, or as a career option.  The process of learning to fly and getting your license requires several steps and usually takes about a year to complete.  The first step is to research local flight schools and potentially do a discovery flight with a flight instructor to see if you enjoy it before committing the time and money.  Should you decide to pursue it, you'll need to find and go to an Aviation Medical Examiner to get checked-out and have a student pilot and medical certificate issued.  Once you've completed that you can begin your training which will include both ground school and flight school.  The next step is to purchase the necessary books, study sufficiently and prepare to take an FAA written exam.  While you're studying, you'll begin your flight training which requires a minimum of 40 hours of flying, however most individuals end-up flying between 60 - 75 hours.  When your instructor feels you're able to demonstrate mastery of all of the required skills and are able to make sound decisions, you'll be ready to take a practical exam with either an FAA examiner or a designated examiner.   Upon successful completion of your test, you'll be issued your pilots license and be ready to take up passengers.  On average, the cost to get your pilot's license ranges from $8,000 to $12,000.  This may sound expensive, but it's worth it to have a skill that you can enjoy for a lifetime."}

Fallout's atmosphere and artwork are reminiscent of post-World War II United States during the Cold War era and the fear that the country was headed for nuclear war in the real world."}
{"instruction": "What are some tricks to baking a really good cake?", "input": "", "output": "There are several things to consider when baking a cake.  Paying particular attention to each will produce a consistent and delicious result.  First, confirm that your oven temperature is correct.  This is easily done with a meat thermometer.  Place the thermometer in the middle of the center rack of the oven, where most food cooks. Then preheat the oven to a baking temperature (e.g. 350 degrees).  After the oven has preheated, check the temperature on the thermometer and confirm that it also reads 350 degrees.   Second, bring your refrigerated ingredients to room temperature before using.  If your recipe calls for butter, do not microwave it as a shortcut.  Doing so will change the consistency of your batter.  Plan ahead and leave butter and eggs out on the counter for at least an hour before you begin baking.  Third, pay close attention to recipe instructions related to sifting and measuring flour.  \"Two cups sifted flour\" does not mean the same thing as \"two cups flour, sifted.\"  The first instruction means to sift the flour, then measure; whereas the second means measure first, then sift what was measured.  In either scenario, do not scoop the measuring cup into the flour bin directly.  This causes the flour to be tightly packed into the cup and will result in a cake that has the texture of a brick.  Instead, use a spoon to lightly scoop flour from the bin into the measuring cup, leveling off the top with a butter knife.  This method is messier, but will yield better results.  Fourth, take the time to cream the butter and sugar well.  The result should be smooth and lump free.  This is the most important step to making an appealing cake, and again can't be expedited by using melted butter!  Fifth, if your recipe calls for both wet ingredients (buttermilk, juice etc) and dry (flour mixture), alternate between the two in small increments rather than dumping them in sequentially.  This small step will protect the texture of your cake.  Sixth, once the cake batter has been poured into the pan, lift the pan and drop it onto the counter from a height of two to three inches.  This will remove any air pockets that may have developed in the batter.  Be careful not to bang the pan too hard, or you'll spill the batter and/or scare your pets out of the kitchen.   And lastly, don't bake the cake for as long as the recipe suggests. Set the timer a few minutes early so that you don't over-bake due to any idiosyncrasy associated with your oven (referenced in step one). Please note this does not mean you should be opening and closing the oven door multiple times during the baking process.  Good bakers know \"if you're looking, it's not cooking,\" so try not to open the oven until your timer goes off.  The only exception to this rule is if you smell something burning.  Odds are this means the batter has spilled out over the pan and onto the bottom of the oven.  if this happens, and the oven is now smoking, you have to open the door and try to remove the spill.

{"instruction": "Give me a one line summary of the story below: \n\nA long long time ago the Queen of Odisha heard that there was a master stone sculptor who made such stunning statues of the gods that people would weep from happiness at the beauty of the statues if they saw them. One summer day, while resting indolently with the King in the main hall of the royal palace, the Queen suddenly had a thought. \"How nice it would be, King, if we could build some beautiful statutes of Lord Jagannath so that the people can come worship Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subadhra. What do you think?\" \n\nThe King thought for a few minutes, and then nodded in agreement. \"What do you have in mind, my Queen?\" And so, soon the stone sculptor was summoned to appear before the Court for an appointment to build in his way the statutes of the gods. Soon the monsoon season started and the sculptor appeared in front of the court, awaiting his appointment. He was a humble man from the mountainous regions of Odisha. Even at his best-dressed, one couldn't help but notice his rough hands, and the small sprinkling of dust that seemed ever present in his hair. \n\nThe King and Queen graciously waited as the sculptor bowed and then asked \"Your majesties, what can I do for you?\" The Queen leaned forward in her throne and her voice rang out in the court \"We have heard, o Master Sculptor, of your skills from people far and wide across the Kingdom. We dream of having you put your skills to use to build beautiful statues that will represent Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra for our people to worship.\"\n\nThe sculptor was silent. As his silence extended, ministers of the court began to feel restless. \"Speak up! How can you be silent when the Queen graces you so!\" But still, the sculptor was silent. \n\nThe King and Queen sat patiently in their thrones as they waited for the sculptor to respond. Perhaps the enormity of the task was too much. Perhaps, the sculptor was thinking of what he should ask for in return. Or even more, perhaps, the sculptor was awed and honored by the request. \n\nAt last, as the shadows from the late afternoon sun began to stretch across the floors of the hall, the sculptor shifted his weight, and opened his mouth to speak. \"Your majesties, you grace me with such a request, I cannot help but oblige. It is an honor.\" At this, the Queen sat as straight as a rod, listening for the words that would come next. \"But, I can do this on one condition only. I will work in a closed hall, where none may enter - regardless of whether they can hear me working or otherwise. None may enter until I open the doors from within and proclaim to all that the statues are completed.\"\n\nThe ministers gasped - what a strange request from this man. Was he a fool? What if he just slept and ate and didn't do any work? How could the King and Queen trust that he would do the work he was promising to do? The Queen looked on thoughtfully. She glanced at the King, and it seemed to her that he agreed on this condition without reservation. She looked at the sculptor and then nodded her assent. \"We decree that you shall build these statues in a hall set aside, into which no one shall enter until your work is complete and you proclaim that to us after opening the doors of the hall from within.\"", "input": "", "output": "A master sculptor in Odisha is hired by the King & Queen to build statutes of Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra, on the condition that no one will disturb the master sculptor from his work, until he himself announces that his work is complete."}

{"instruction": "Write a short story about a person who gets fired from his job, but ends up having the best day of his life.", "input": "", "output": "On March 3rd 1974, Jim was fired from his job as a janitor at Elmhurst Elementary School. While officially, Jim was let go due to \"budgetary constraints\", it was quite clear to him that it had more to do with his age than any financial strain on the school district. See, Jim was born in 1899, he had just turned 75 years old in January and was starting to \"slow down\" on the job. He could no longer do some of the highly intensive labor that his profession often entailed, and it became noticeable. \n\nAfter his last day of work, Jim walked to his home, which conveniently was only three blocks south of the school. On his walk, he couldn't help but feel sad and slightly embarrassed. He knew that his wife, Miriam, would understand, but he felt like he let her and himself down. For nearly 40 years, Jim worked at Elmhurst Elementary School and was beloved by the thousands of students that came through those doors. While he wasn't going to miss cleaning up student's throw-up or a cafeteria that resembled more of a war zone than a public eating space, he was going to miss the children. Watching them learn, play, and grow was always what made the job worth it to him.\n\nWhen Jim walked through the door of his one story home, Miriam was there to greet him. She could tell what had happened by the look on his face. Particularly, she could tell by his eyes. Jim's eyes were a portal into his soul and, as such, a window into his emotions.\n\nAs Jim walked through the living room and into the kitchen, he saw two people, a man and a woman, sitting at the table, and in the woman's arms was a baby. This man was his son, Tommy, who he had not seen since he deployed for the Vietnam War three years prior. Up until this moment, Jim wasn't even sure if his son was alive. Jim's eyes opened wide with sheer elation at the sight, and a tear slowly formed in the corner of his left eye.\n\nOver the next few hours, Jim sat with his son and his family and discussed all that had happened since the last time they had seen each other. Tommy spoke about how he had been designated as MIA by the US government after a particularly brutal ambush during one of his morning patrols. After many months of hiding from the enemy and searching for his unit, Tommy eventually stumbled across one of the final remaining US camps stationed in South Vietnam. It was at this camp that Tommy met his now wife, Sara. She was the nurse who oversaw his recovery. They fell in love immediately, got married, and Sara became pregnant, all before even leaving Vietnam for the United States. Tommy and Sara had returned to the US only a month ago, and their baby was born two weeks later.\n\nWhile Jim laid in bed that night, he couldn't believe all the change that one day could bring. He woke up a janitor, and went to bed a grandfather. He knew his new job, and he looked forward to it. This was the best day of his life."}

I demand you to come down this instant!” my stepmother demanded.\n“I’m busy!” I scream back from my room. I’m not actually busy, I’m just on my phone texting about the big party tonight. My friends and I are planning it out step by step, and hopefully at the end of the night, one of us will score a hot boy.\n“ You haven’t done any chores all month! I wish you were more like your step-sisters,” my stepmother continues angrily. The last part about my step-sisters really infuriated me. I storm downstairs ready to make a point that I’m not going to do chores for someone who isn’t my real mom.\n“Well maybe you're just jealous you didn’t peak in high school. I bet no one wanted to be your friend in school,” I argue. I put a smug look on my face, thinking that I totally just won this argument.\n“If you want to act like that I’ll give you the same treatment,” she warns me. She crosses her arms and taps her foot impatiently waiting for my response.\n“Whatever, if your're so fond of my step-sisters they can just do my chores,” I sigh as I roll my eyes.\n“You need to learn how to take care of yourself. Soon enough, your only achievement would be peaking in high school. You’re going to end up as a fast-food worker if you keep acting like this,” She reasons whilst she stares at me with daggers in her eyes.\n        \n                        “Fine, I’ll do the laundry. After I have to go to the mall, my friends and I are going dress shopping for the party,” I groan. I have to text my friends that I will be five minutes late. I grab my phone to message them.\n“Just the laundry isn’t enough for all of the chores you have ignored. You turn eighteen in two years, and you need to prepare for the real world. You will not go to the party; what you will do is stay here until you cleaned and organized the entire house to make up for the several years of not doing any chores at all,” She states.\nI can’t believe my ears. My life is literally ruined. She is seriously out to get me I swear. I flip my hair and start to walk over to my room.\n“I’m going to run some errands. When I’m back, I expect all the clothes to be folded, the kitchen wiped down, etcetera. Perhaps if you finish fast enough, you can still make it to the party. Maybe.” She orders and walks out of the house.\nThis is child abuse. I stomp my foot in frustration and call all my friends. I complain about all of the evil things my stepmother just did to me.\n                        “You should just sneak out, you do it all the time for parties,” One of my friend suggests.\n                “I would, but if my stepmother noticed I didn’t clean everything she’s probably going to take away my allowance and phone. You guys now I can’t live without those!” I point out. I pace back and forth around my room trying to think. I see an empty closet and get the perfect idea.\n           “What if I just throw in all the dirty things into the closet! That will give me enough time. She probably won’t notice for a couple of days. It’s flawless!” I proposed. Everyone agrees so I went straight to work. It only took me five minutes and I was out of the house and on my way to the mall. \n     —------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          “Dress shopping was so fun! I’m glad I could make it.” I remarked. Everyone nods in agreement. I check the time on my phone.\n                “Guys! I didn’t realize it would take us that long to find out dresses, the parties in ten minutes!” I gasp, we all run into one of our cars and arrive to the party.\n                I look around the venue. This place looks so cool, there’s a dance floor in the middle where many people are at so I head there. I see a super handsome boy in the corner of my eye, I walk over to ask him to dance. He notices me too as I reach my hand out signaling we should dance. \n          We dance until our feet are sore. It is such a nice moment, I can’t wait to brag to my friends later. I go to take a seat with him but I see my mom enter the party. I quickly run out the door and the boy I just danced with starts following. My shoe falls off but I don’t stop running until I’m back home.\n —------------------------------------------------------\n     I wake up the next morning exhausted from last night. I look at the clock and it turns out I slept until 10 am. I walk downstairs to see my mom talking to someone at the door. I look to see who it was and it was the boy I danced with last night. How did he find me? \n                He sees me peeking and waves to me. He explains to me my friends also noticed my dramatic exit and told him where my house was. He then gets on his knees and takes out a ring.\n              “Will you marry me?” He asks me. I immediately knew my answer.\n                           “No”"}

It’s time to put on your long underwear. Slip in some wool socks and a sweater. Climb into your snowpants. Pull down your stocking cap. Grab your fi shing rod and bait bucket.\nThere’s ice on the lake, and it’s the season to enjoy a true Minnesota adventure, —ice fishing. Don’t worry about getting cold or bored on a frozen lake. Ice fishing is both easy and exciting. It’s fun to hike across the ice imagining hungry sunnies or walleyes lurking below. It’s an adventure to hang out around an ice hole with friends and family, telling stories and holding a funny looking fishing rod as you wait for a bite. And it’s thrilling when your bobber suddenly  vanishes down the hole, and you pull a slippery fish from the water with a splash. So grab a grown-up, a Thermos of hot cocoa, and get ready for an ice fishing adventure.\n\nStart with a visit to your local bait store or DNR Fisheries office. Folks there can tell you in which lakes the fish are biting and where you can get onto the lake. They can also tell you where the ice is most likely to be OK. Wind, warm weather, underwater springs, and currents can all make ice unsafe. Ice must be at least 4 inches thick before you walk on it. (See Be Safe, page 45.) Once you know the ice is thick enough, you can go find a fishing spot. Here are three ways to look: § If you know where fish hang out in summer, go there. Fish usually go to the same places in winter. § Pick up a lake map at the bait shop or DNR and look for shallow areas or drop-offs (where the bottom gets deep quickly). Fish are more likely to be there. § Look for anglers congregated at the best fishing holes. Ask if you can fish near them. (It’s not polite to drill holes too close to other anglers.) If the fish aren’t biting in one spot, try another.\n\nYou can use a regular reel, or some anglers use a device called a tip-up instead. A tipup has two sticks. One lies across the hole. The other points down into the hole and has a spool with line. When a fish takes your bait, a flag springs up from the stick across the hole. Then you pull the fish up with the line. Tip-ups are fun because you can watch them while reading a book or tossing a Frisbee.\n\n1.\tCut a Hole.\na.\tTo catch fish through the ice, you must first drill a hole. To drill a hole, ice anglers use a tool called an auger, which looks like a giant screw with a sharp blade on the end. Another handy tool is a spud, a long-handled chisel with a sharp blade for checking ice thickness and chipping extra ice from the hole. Anglers use a scoop, a big spoon with holes, to clean out ice shavings.\n\n2.\t Find the Depth\na.\tIf you know the depth of the water, you have a better idea what fish to fish for. Bluegills and northerns like shallow water. Look for walleyes in deeper water. Some anglers use an electronic fish locator or a lead weight on a hook. You can also tie a string to a weight, hold the loose end in one hand, and drop the weigh to the bottom. Then measure the length of string that’s down the hole. The simplest solution is to use a weighted hook, which drops to the bottom. Then you reel it up to fish as far off the bottom as you like. \n\n3.\tLand your Catch\na.\tWhen you feel a fish on the line, reel it up steadily but not too fast because you might yank out the hook. When you see the fish, ask your adult fishing buddy to lift it out. After landing a fish, remove it from the hook. It’s easier to get a hook out with pliers than with your hands in cold weather. If the fish is too big or too small to keep, return it to the water. Or put your catch in a bucket or a snowbank. Watch out for dogs! A dog might try to run away with your catch! It happens. \n\n4.\tUse Good Manners\na.\tBe polite and don’t disturb your fellow anglers with loud talk or goofing around. Always pick up your trash and anything else you brought. Remember: Anything you leave on the lake will go into the water when the ice melts."}

{"instruction": "Write me a script for an upcoming All Hands meeting about our IPO prospects and how employees need to act in the quiet period.", "input": "", "output": "Lately, I've received plenty of questions about a potential IPO. I want to answer those questions today — and talk about how we as a company will answer questions like that moving forward.\n\nFor years, we’ve shared that one of our aspirations is to build a wildly successful public company. Everyone has a role to play in getting us there and delivering for customers and growing the business is the most important thing most of us can do.\n\nA typical milestone on a high-growth journey is an IPO. But as companies get more serious about a potential IPO, there is a period where they stop talking about an IPO.  This might be counter-intuitive, but here’s why: there are important regulatory restrictions on what companies can and cannot say when it comes to company growth and plans as they approach becoming a public company. The consequences if you don’t follow those rules can be serious — the SEC can even delay our ability to go public if it determines we’ve improperly promoted an IPO. And that’s obviously a situation we want to avoid, should we be in a position to go public in the future.  \n\nAnd even language like this — \"should we be in a position to go public in the future\" — is vague. That's for a reason: as we get closer to an IPO, what we can say is restricted and we need to make sure we don’t make promises, otherwise regulators could force us to delay our plans.\n\nSo I’m going to share some updates about how we’ll need to communicate related to a potential IPO:\n\nIn order to preserve the ability to IPO at some point in the future, the executive team and I will not be sharing explicit details on our IPO journey or timing at All Hands or in other company communications. We also won’t be sharing updates to our market valuation. \n\nHiring managers and recruiters should not explicitly talk about an IPO or our revenue growth with candidates. Instead, emphasize our massive opportunity, how we’re innovating, delivering value to our customers, and what an awesome team we have.  \n\nWe can’t engage with public market investors or financial journalists on certain topics. That means if a financial analyst, research analyst or reporter reaches out to you, don’t respond and forward the email to the communications team.\n\nWe also can’t talk about a potential IPO on social media or with friends and family. You get the idea.\n\nI know that this will be different for us. We’ve always been a transparent company and this change is hopefully a short-term one. But it is an important one and you all have a role to play in helping us remain compliant.\n\nWe all have different, important roles to play in making this company a successful, long-term business. The most important thing we can all do is to continue delivering for our customers and building a successful business."}

{"instruction": "Without quoting directly from the text give me a summary the game of chess", "input": "", "output": "Chess is a two player turn based abstract strategy board game with the goal of checkmating the opponents King. The game originated from a similar board game from India called Chatarunga, which was played during the 17th century.\n\nChess boards have 64 squares arranged into an 8x8 grid with alternating white and black squares. Each player controls 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 bishops, 2 rooks, 2 knights, and eight pawns. Each piece has a predefined mode of movement. Each player's pieces are uniformly colored; for example if player one has the white pieces, player one will start the match. \n\nCheckmating the opponents king requires the opponent to position their pieces into an attacking arrangement that prohibits the defending players king from moving. This is usually accomplished by closing in on their defending opponents king and systematically working towards positions where the king can no longer move without being taken. If the king is under attack (meaning the king is in a position where the opponents next move will take the king) the defensive player must either take the attacking piece with any piece on the board or move the king to a position where the king is no longer under attach, this configuration is called \"Check\" or being \"Checked\". Chess matches can also end in a draw.\n\nChess arose in popularity in the 19th century and is governed internationally by the FIDE (international chess federation). Magnus Carlsen is the current world champion (2023) and the game has a huge body of theory associated with playing the game. \n\nThe game has influenced western culture in the fields of art, mathematics, computer science and psychology. Computer scientists have used chess as a method for developing algorithms that can play chess. In 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer to beat a human opponent, beating the current world champion Garry Kasparov at that time. Today's chess playing machines are significantly more powerful and have been influenced by the best chess players in the world."}

{"instruction": "Who is Anne Francis?", "input": "", "output": "Anne Francis, née Gittins (1738 – 7 November 1800) was an English classical scholar and poet. She is notable for a poetic translation of the Bible's Song of Songs that focuses on the dramatic action of the song, rather than its Christian allegorical interpretation.\n\nAnne Gittins was born in 1738 as the daughter of the Rev. Daniel Gittins, rector of South Stoke, near Arundel, Sussex. She was educated by her father in the classics and Hebrew. She married the Rev. Robert Bransby Francis, rector of Edgefield, near Holt, Norfolk.\n\nThough she lacked formal classical training, Anne Francis was in contact with the leading Old Testament scholars of the time: her Poetical Translation of the Song of Songs was dedicated to John Parkhurst, and other subscribers included Robert Lowth and Benjamin Kennicott. The Poetical Translation focused on what she saw as the direct dramatic action of the song, rather than its Christian allegorical interpretation. Taking a cue from Thomas Harmer, Francis distinguished the voice of an \"Egyptian Spouse\" from that of a \"Jewish Queen\": in this love triangle, Solomon's marriage to the daughter of Pharaoh being resented by an earlier wife.\n\nFrancis's translation has not received much continuing attention. Yet in the verdict of one recent commentator, Francis's \"insistence on bringing together learning and feeling, what she knew as male and female worlds, makes her Song of Songs an outstanding feminist monument.\"\n\nIn 1787, Francis changed publishers to raise her voice in response to Goethe's \"Charlotte to Werther. A Poetical Epistle\". Throughout the 1790s, she further strengthened the reactionary side of the political divide by periodically publishing work.\n\nDespite Francis's lack of formal education, she aided in efforts to adapt French and German playscripts, as did various other female writers.\n\nAnne Francis died on 7 November 1800, at the age of 62."}

In tennis, players also hit the ball back and forth but they hit it to each other over a net. In tennis, the ball has a fuzzy outer layer which causes the ball's trajectory to be more influenced by the spin on the ball. The rackets in tennis are larger and have higher tension.\n\nA tennis court is much larger than a racquetball court measuring 78 ft long and 36 ft wide. This width is reduced in tennis to 27 ft for a singles match.\n\nThese are just a few of the differences but there are many more: scoring, attire, court markings, etc."}

The acquiring bank then pays the merchant the amount of the transaction minus both the interchange fee and an additional, usually smaller, fee for the acquiring bank or independent sales organization (ISO), which is often referred to as a discount rate, an add-on rate, or passthru. For cash withdrawal transactions at ATMs, however, the fees are paid by the card-issuing bank to the acquiring bank (for the maintenance of the machine)."}

If it has been sunny and dry for a week and you are still getting the leak, shut the water off and see if the leak stops.  If it does, then that is likely from an internal leak.  If it is in fact an internal leak, then call a reputable local plumber to have them test your pipes for pressure loss.  If it is an external leak, then wait for sunny weather.  After about a week of dry sunny weather, get a garden hose and pick a feature of your roof or external walls and spray that feature (vent pipe, window, roof juncture, etc) with a direct stream of high volume and low velocity water from the garden hose.  Wait for a few hours, and see if the leak appears.  After four hours, if no leak has appeared, then move on to the next feature.  If hosing down a specific feature does in fact cause dripping within that four hour window, then either call a roof repair company or go to your local hardware store and talk to an expert about ways to seal cracks or gaps in siding or roofing material."}

{"instruction": "Who does Machiavelli believe exemplifies the characteristics of a true prince in The Prince, and why does he hold this belief?", "input": "", "output": "In Machiavelli’s, The Prince, Machiavelli describes in great detail the extent to which a true prince should rule their state to ensure complete dominance and obedience of its people. He explains the numerous prerequisites and responsibilities of a prince, in which he exemplifies throughout the text through the different figures, in both positive and negative contexts. Throughout The Prince, one figure, who Machiavelli makes clear he has great respect for, highlighting quite frequently, is Cesare Borgia whom he even refers to with the status comparable to the level of God exclaiming that “there was one man who showed glimpses of greatness... that made you think he was sent by God” (26). Similar rhetoric is frequently used to describe Cesare Borgia throughout the text. In search of who truly exemplifies the characterization of “The Prince,” it can generally seem to be Cesare Borgia from the high praise of Machiavelli, but in reality this is not the case. Rather, the title of “The Prince” belongs to a more subtle figure: Ferdinand of Aragon, the King of Spain. This connection is made because of the numerous contradictions Machiavelli makes in praise of Cesare Borgia and other important figures in the text, while many key characteristics of a true prince that Machiavelli speaks of hold without contradiction for Ferdinand.\nMachiavelli exemplifies his teachings through Cesare Borgia’s actions seen in chapter 7 when Cesare Borgia conquered the state of Romagna: immediately crushing the opponent using great cruelty, using a scapegoat to thwart the hatred away from him, and finally killing the scapegoat to create a sense of power and fear within the new states inhabitants. These actions, that explain why he is so highly idolized by Machiavelli, do not go without the fact that other\n \n fundamental characteristics of Cesare Borgia directly contradict Machiavelli's notion of the most dominant prince. A prime example is in how “Cesare Borgia... acquired his state during the ascendancy of his father, and on its decline he lost it” (7). Inheritance obviously requires significantly less effort compared to creating a new principality. Although Cesare Borgia later conquers new principalities, it can be inferred that a rise to power through his fathers fortune was a significant catalyst and does not exemplify virtues of the ideal prince.\nOther figures in the book receive similar praise in leadership abilities, but still lack what qualities compare to the ideal prince. These figures include Pope Julius II, whose power is highlighted by Machiavelli in chapter 13 as being consistent more with fortune rather than virtù in his campaign for conquer, Pope Alexander VI, who although displays cunning ability to bring the catholic empire eventual dominance and power, did so with the initial help of being “granted a title and income from the Roman Catholic Church by his uncle Alonso”.1 Many figures follow the same pattern in that they follow many principles exemplified in The Prince, but of course with so many requisites to be a true prince, these figures do not follow the explicit definition of a prince. One figure however, follows Machiavelli’s points very closely and exemplifies the fundamentals of a true prince in his beginnings, leaving almost no flaws in his rise to becoming a true prince: Ferdinand of Aragon.\nFerdinand’s characteristics lead him to the title of “The Prince” but a core virtù is what truly sets him apart from the other figures: his rise to power. Almost immediately in The Prince, Machiavelli describes the differences between principalities and emphasizes how maintaining a\n1 “Alexander VI.” Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-VI.\n \nnew principality is far more difficult than inheritance. This is largely evident in Ferdinand’s rise to leadership in what Machiavelli describes him as “, by fame and glory, from being an insignificant king to be the foremost king in Christendom” (21). Ferdinand demonstrates his cunning deception through his plot for power, “always using religion as a plea, so as to undertake greater schemes,  himself with pious cruelty to driving out and clearing his kingdom of the Moors” (21). Machiavelli marks this never being “a more admirable example, nor one more rare” in which he uses religion as a cloak of invisibility to deceptively conquer states (21). These natural abilities are what make Ferdinand admirable and what separate him from the rest of the figures in the text. This feeling is shared by Machiavelli exclaiming “that his actions have arisen in such a way, one out of the other, that men have never been given time to work steadily against him” (21)."}
{"instruction": "Give me a proof that the square root of 2 is irrational", "input": "", "output": "Here is a proof by contradiction that the square root of 2 is irrational. First, recall that irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written as p / q for integers p and q. Assume for contradiction that the square root of 2 is rational, which would mean that sqrt(2) = p / q for some integers p and q. Further assume without loss of generality that this fraction is in reduced form, meaning that p and q share no common factors. We can assume this because any integer fraction can be written in such a reduced form, so the existence of any rational representation for sqrt(2) would imply the existence of one in reduced form. Now we square both sides of the above equation, yielding\n\n2 = p^2 / q^2\n\nfor some integers p and q not sharing any common factors. Now multiply by q^2 to get\n\n2 * q^2 = p^2\n\nNote that the left hand side is even due to the factor of 2, so the right hand side p^2 is even as well. This means that p must be even as well, otherwise p^2 would not be even. So p can be written as 2 * x for some integer x. Substituting this into the above equation, we get\n\n2 * q^2 = (2 * x)^2 = 2^2 * x^2\n\nNote that both sides of the equation have a factor of 2 we can cancel. Doing this, we get\n\nq^2 = 2 * x^2\n\nBy an argument analogous to the one above, we can conclude that q is even. However this contradicts our assumption that p and q shared no common factors. Therefore our initial assumption that sqrt(2) is rational was false, which is what we set out to prove."}
{"instruction": "what is cricket and why is it popular in Asian countries?", "input": "", "output": "Cricket is one of the most popular sports in Asian countries. One of the worlds biggest cricket teams are India. The reason for so much popularity is multifold. Top reason is when English invaded South east asia they brought this game to the continent. Originally this game was only played by upper class, and later adopted by other classes as well. To play cricket you need one bat and one ball. Bat will be made up of wood and ball can be either tennis ball or hard ball which is made up of leather. You need a wicket which is 3 sticks and 2 bails on top. One person throws the ball and other person try to protect his wickets with the bat. The length of the wicket is 22 yards. Batsman can hit the ball for runs. To make runs, there are two ways. First is to hit the boundary, which can fetch either 4 or 6 runs. Second way is to run between the wickets and make as many runs as you can. There are other ways to get runs as well, like if its a wide ball or no ball. For a team to win a match, they either have to make more runs then the other team or get them all out before they can make more runs then them. Most popular cricket format is T20, then One day internationals (ODI) and then Test matches. T20 is the shortest form and have 20 overs and 2 innings. ODI has 50 overs and 2 innings. Whereas Test is the longest format and can carry on for 5 days, with 90 overs every day and up to 2 innings per team. Both men and women play cricket. Worlds biggest cricket league is IPL in india. PSL in Pakistan is considered as the second best league. There are 2 cricket worldcups. T20 worldcup is played every 2 years and ODI worldcup is played every 4 years. There is also World Test and ODI championship as well, which is player every year."}

{"instruction": "What is Chromosomal Deletion Syndrome?", "input": "", "output": "Chromosomal deletion syndromes result from deletion of parts of chromosomes. Depending on the location, size, and whom the deletion is inherited from, there are a few known different variations of chromosome deletions. Chromosomal deletion syndromes typically involve larger deletions that are visible using karyotyping techniques. Smaller deletions result in Microdeletion syndrome, which are detected using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)\n\nExamples of chromosomal deletion syndromes include 5p-Deletion (cri du chat syndrome), 4p-Deletion (Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome), Prader–Willi syndrome, and Angelman syndrome.\n\nThe chromosomal basis of Cri du chat syndrome consists of a deletion of the most terminal portion of the short arm of chromosome 5. 5p deletions, whether terminal or interstitial, occur at different breakpoints; the chromosomal basis generally consists of a deletion on the short arm of chromosome 5. The variability seen among individuals may be attributed to the differences in their genotypes. With an incidence of 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 50,000 live births, it is suggested to be one of the most common contiguous gene deletion disorders. 5p deletions are most common de novo occurrences, which are paternal in origin in 80–90% of cases, possibly arising from chromosome breakage during gamete formation in males.\n\nSome examples of the possible dysmorphic features include: downslanting palpebral fissures, broad nasal bridge, microcephaly, low-set ears, preauricular tags, round faces, short neck, micrognathia, and dental malocclusionhypertelorism, epicanthal folds, downturned corners of the mouth. There is no specific correlation found between size of deletion and severity of clinical features because the results vary so widely.\n\nThe chromosomal basis of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) consists of a deletion of the most terminal portion of the short arm of chromosome 4. The deleted segment of reported individuals represent about one half of the p arm, occurring distal to the bands 4p15.1-p15.2. The proximal boundary of the WHSCR was defined by a 1.9 megabase terminal deletion of 4p16.3. This allele includes the proposed candidate genes LEMT1 and WHSC1. This was identified by two individuals that exhibited all 4 components of the core WHS phenotype, which allowed scientists to trace the loci of the deleted genes. Many reports are particularly striking in the appearance of the craniofacial structure (prominent forehead, hypertelorism, the wide bridge of the nose continuing to the forehead) which has led to the descriptive term “Greek warrior helmet appearance\".\n\nThere is wide evidence that the WHS core phenotype (growth delay, intellectual disability, seizures, and distinctive craniofacial features) is due to haploinsufficiency of several closely linked genes as opposed to a single gene. Related genes that impact variation include:\n\nWHSC1 spans a 90-kb genomic region, two-thirds of which maps in the telomeric end of the WHCR; WHSC1 may play a significant role in normal development. Its deletion likely contributes to the WHS phenotype. However, variation in severity and phenotype of WHS suggests possible roles for genes that lie proximally and distally to the WHSCR.\nWHSC2 (also known as NELF-A) is involved in multiple aspects of mRNA processing and the cell cycle\nSLBP, a gene encoding Stem Loop Binding Protein, resides telomeric to WHSC2, and plays a crucial role in regulating histone synthesis and availability during S phase.\nLETM1 has initially been proposed as a candidate gene for seizures; it functions in ion exchange with potential roles in cell signaling and energy production.\nFGFRL1, encoding a putative fibroblast growth factor decoy receptor, has been implicated in the craniofacial phenotype and potentially other skeletal features, and short stature of WHS.\nCPLX1 has lately been suggested as a potential candidate gene for epilepsy in WHS.\n\nPrader–Willi (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are distinct neurogenetic disorders caused by chromosomal deletions, uniparental disomy or loss of the imprinted gene expression in the 15q11-q13 region. Whether an individual exhibits PWS or AS depends on if there is a lack of the paternally expressed gene to contribute to the region.[citation needed]\n\nPWS is frequently found to be the reason for secondary obesity due to early onset hyperphagia - the abnormal increase in appetite for consumption of food. There are known three molecular causes of Prader–Willi syndrome development. One of them consists in micro-deletions of the chromosome region 15q11–q13. 70% of patients present a 5–7-Mb de novo deletion in the proximal region of the paternal chromosome 15. The second frequent genetic abnormality (~ 25–30% of cases) is maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15. The mechanism is due to maternal meiotic non-disjunction followed by mitotic loss of the paternal chromosome 15 after fertilization. The third cause for PWS is the disruption of the imprinting process on the paternally inherited chromosome 15 (epigenetic phenomena). This disruption is present in approximately 2–5% of affected individuals. Less than 20% of individuals with an imprinting defect are found to have a very small deletion in the PWS imprinting centre region, located at the 5′ end of the SNRPN gene.\n\nAS is a severe debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by mental retardation, speech impairment, seizures, motor dysfunction, and a high prevalence of autism. The paternal origin of the genetic material that is affected in the syndrome is important because the particular region of chromosome 15 involved is subject to parent-of-origin imprinting, meaning that for a number of genes in this region, only one copy of the gene is expressed while the other is silenced through imprinting. For the genes affected in PWS, it is the maternal copy that is usually imprinted (and thus is silenced), while the mutated paternal copy is not functional."}

A small p-value indicates that it is very unlikely that the observed result came about by chance. \nHowever, whether an alternative hypothesis with a p-value of less than 0.05 should be accepted without providing further evidence is controversial. Therefore, to properly quantify the statistical significance of results, contextual factors must also be considered, such as the quality of the measurements, the external evidence, and the validity of the assumptions underlying the data analysis."}

{"instruction": "Which is better - skiing or snowboarding", "input": "", "output": "I prefer skiing over snowboarding. For three reasons: safety, reliability, and expediency\n\nSafety - snowboarding can be a very dangerous sport. I'd been skiing and snowboarding for years. One winter I had a snowboarding accident and slid into a tree. Snowboarding requires larger turns with a bigger radius. I wasn't able to turn in time to avoid the tree. \n\nReliability - The thing about being on only a single piece of equipment is that your balance relies much more on the snow conditions. Under ideal conditions, its great to be able to snowboard and maintain control with the edge. Skiing on powder is also a dream. However, if the conditions are less than ideal, then snowboarding on ice becomes a dangerous, out of control situation. Skiing on ice is also no picnic, but at least you can stabilize and balance on your two skis. \n\nExpediency - Skiing with friends inevitably means that you are waiting for the slowest one before you can start down the mountain. I was that friend. Snowboarders have to sit down and strap in, while skiers can pretty much get right off the lift and start down the mountain immediately. This makes mixed groups of skiers and snowboarders the trickiest. So I would sometimes snowboard if I was traveling with snowboarders, and ski if I was traveling with skiers."}

{"instruction": "What is Photosynthesis", "input": "", "output": "Photosynthesis is performed differently by different species but the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction centers that contain green chlorophyll (and other colored) pigments/chromophores. In plants, these proteins are held inside organelles called chloroplasts, which are most abundant in leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in the plasma membrane. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that serve as short-term stores of energy, enabling its transfer to drive other reactions: these compounds are reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the \"energy currency\" of cells.\n\nIn plants, algae and cyanobacteria, sugars are synthesized by a subsequent sequence of light-independent reactions called the Calvin cycle. In the Calvin cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated into already existing organic carbon compounds, such as ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting compounds are then reduced and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as glucose. In other bacteria, different mechanisms such as the reverse Krebs cycle are used to achieve the same end."}

These people could be underprivileged because of several factors: ethnicity, religion, colour, language, nationality, gender, etc. The other people who do not come under the underprivileged section are the normal people.\n\nThe underprivileged people suffer major struggles in their life over decades or sometime over centuries. On the social development indices such as literacy, life expectancy, incarceration, health conditions, etc.. the underprivileged people lag behind the normal people significantly. Examples of underprivileged people include the indigenous people in many countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, USA and also the people of African descent in the USA. \n\nThe people from the underprivileged communities have to brought into the mainstream and in order to achieve this objective,  the required job and career opportunities have to be created. Education is a powerful tool to equip the people to gain the skills required to perform the roles. These people have been deprived of education for a long time and so the governments and the social leaders have to take the initiatives to extend education to the underprivileged. There has to be a concerted effort over a long time, some times for even 50 to 100 years, to improve the skill levels of the underprivileged people by focusing on education and training.\n\nThe underprivileged people have to be empowered citizens of the society. In order to enable these people to overcome the handicap of the suppression they have suffered for a long time, leaders from these communities have to be involved in the decision making and governance forums in the society.  As an example, in Indian Parliament around 24% of the seats are reserved only for people from the underprivileged sections to contest and get elected to become members of the parliament. Using this model to reserve seats for the. underprivileged in the governance bodies, we can provide opportunity for the underprivileged to participate in the governance and enact laws that will protect their interests. \n\nA combination of education and empowerment would go a long way in improving the life of the underprivileged people in the society."}

{"instruction": "Should heritage trees in Palo Alto be protected once they become a danger to people and homes?", "input": "", "output": "Strong winds driven, likely driven by climate change,  are posing new challenges to tree protection ordinances in northern California cities like Palo Alto, California. Climate change has caused stronger winds to occur in SF Bay Area. These strong gusts, some of which can be over 60 mph, are causing large, historic trees to fall onto houses threatening costly real estate as well as peoples lives. In the city of Palo Alto, California Oaks and Redwoods are classified as heritage trees. These majestic trees grow throughout the city and for many years have been vigilantly protected.  These trees are considered part of the city's unique character and history, therefore a part of its heritage.  Heritage trees cannot be cut down without the permission of a special city governance body and getting this okay to do so is very hard if not impossible to do.  The trees are beautiful and protecting them is noble, but  in the new era of unprecedented high winds some residents are asking if  their protection should be reconsidered given the risk they present to people and their homes during a storm. \n\nWhile storms are dramatic and do cause damage, they also occur infrequently and are a natural part of life.  Heritage oak and redwood trees which take hundreds of years to grow do pose some risks to homes and people should they fall, but overall they pose an insignificant risk to humans and buildings and need to continue to be protected in order to continue to provide their many benefits to humans."}

{"instruction": "Give me a few ways that I could travel from Munich to Rome and list the advantages and disadvantages for each.", "input": "", "output": "Here are several ways that you could travel from Munich to Rome:\n\n1. By air - Plane travel is probably the most common and fastest way to travel from Munich to Rome. Depending on when you fly, your ticket class, and how close to your departure date that you buy your tickets, pricing can vary from less than $100 (91 Euros) to over $500 (455 Euros). Be sure to plan your trip and purchase tickets in advance to ensure that you save money. Also, while Munich has one major airport (MUC), Rome has two large international airports (FCO and CIA). It will take roughly 90 minutes by plane to travel from Munich to Rome, not accounting for time in the airport, security lines and customs.\n\n2. By train - Traveling by train is another common way to get from Munich to Rome. While it will take longer than by air, tickets are very inexpensive and can be purchased the day of travel. A one way train ticket from Munich to Rome will cost roughly $35 (32 Euros), and take between 9-12 hours, depending on the route and number of stops.\n\n3. By car - Traveling by car from Munich to Rome is also an option. With limited stops, it will take roughly 10 hours to drive from Munich to Rome, but having a car will allow you flexibility to stop along the way at any cities or sites that you want to see. \n\nDepending on your specific needs, all three of these options could be viable ways to travel from Munich to Rome."}

{"instruction": "Is brazilian jiu jitsu good for self defense?", "input": "", "output": "Brazilian Jiujitsu, or BJJ, is known as the gentle art in martial arts.  BJJ can be practiced in two modalities: Sport BJJ and the other as self defense. Sport BJJ is competitive and based on a point system based on a competitor being awarded a number of points based on advancing to a more advantageous position. Alternatively, a competitor may immediately win the match by submission. When BJJ is used in self defense, the goal is usually to subdue an attacker.  Since BJJ is mostly grappling from the ground, it can be a highly effective practice for self defense as many street fights end up on the ground. While many of the techniques are intended to immobilize an opponent, it can be less effective if the opponent has an unfair advantage such as the use of a weapon. Practicing BJJ routinely will prepare the practitioner mentally for physical combat which can be advantageous in a self defense scenario. Another reason BJJ can be viewed as good for self defense is that there are techniques that can work well for different body types that level the playing field for even smaller or weaker opponents. If both opponents are trained in BJJ, size and strength can become a larger factor.  Routine training can also lead to increased physical fitness as classes can be quite rigorous and physically demanding. Some may argue that more ruthless martial arts are intentionally designed for self defense and therefore may be more effective."}

{"instruction": "What are the different types of art?", "input": "", "output": "There isn’t one single agreed classification of art forms. In part, this is because there is not one single definition of art! \n\nSome people consider art a creative process that gives only aesthetic pleasure, and does not serve any utilitarian purpose. However, even with this definition, there is not a clear dividing line between art and utilitarian creative processes. For example, some people consider the literary arts to comprise poetry, fiction, non-fiction, and drama. We can clearly understand that non-fiction has a utilitarian purpose to educate and communicate, and arguably the other literary arts do too. So that definition of art as serving no utilitarian purpose is not very black-and-white. \n\nIf we consider art to be any creative endeavor that provides aesthetic pleasure, and that it might also be utilitarian, then there are many forms of art. Below is a partial listing, together with some of the ways these are commonly grouped together. \n\n\nArt form | Can be classified as\nPoetry | Literary arts, fine arts\nFiction | Literary arts\nNon-fiction | Literary arts\nDrama / theater | Performing arts, literary arts\nSculpture | Visual arts, fine arts, plastic arts\nPainting | Visual arts, fine arts\nGlassblowing | Visual arts\nCeramics | Visual arts, plastic arts\nOrigami | Visual arts, plastic arts\nWoodworking | Sculpture, plastic arts\nMusic | Performing arts, fine arts\nDance | Performing arts, fine arts\nFilm-making / cinematography | Performing arts, visual arts, media arts\nPhotography | Visual arts, media arts\nOpera | Performing arts, visual arts\nFood preparation | Culinary arts\nFood styling | Visual arts, culinary arts\nArchitecture | Fine arts\n\nThere are also subcategories of many of these art forms, for example:\nSculpture using different materials can have its own subcategory. Some people consider glassblowing or wood carving to be subcategories of sculpture.\nWoodworking has sub-specialties including engraving, furniture-making, and carving.\n  \nThere is also disagreement about including utilitarian disciplines as a form of art. Architecture is a good example of this. It is highly regulated, requires engineering skill, and provides clear useful benefits, so it doesn’t meet the standard of “purely aesthetic”. Still, it is common to consider architecture an art form, and most people agree that architecture can provide aesthetic pleasure.\n\nAs you can see, there isn’t a single way to classify art forms, although there is consensus about some of the most common groupings."}

I was in DC that week for a work trip, and had extended my stay the weekend before and after, so we could spend time together. We'd only met a month prior, and after more than four weeks of long-distance text message exchanges,  it was exciting to finally be together in person. Our first date had been the weekend before, when we'd gone to a Jimmy Buffett concert. It was a magical night.\nIt was now 10am on the Saturday after the work week, and we were ready for another adventure.  Natalie, being from DC, wanted to show me the Dumbarton Oaks Gardens, so off we went.  Unfortunately, when we got there, the front gates were closed.  Still feeling adventurous, we decided to walk around the property, convinced we'd find an unlocked gate, door, or other way to get in.  Towards the back end of the property, while we didn't find an open gate, we did find one that was scale-able.  And that's exactly what we did.  We climbed over that fence, and welcomed ourselves to the beautiful gardens.  It was early august, and so much was still in bloom.  The gardens were empty,  and we thought we had the whole place to ourselves.  But, we soon found that that wasn't the case.  While exploring a small cottage that also seemed to double as an art gallery, we noticed a small pool right next to it.  We also noticed someone swimming in that pool. Presumably that person noticed us too, because a few minutes later a security guard came walking up to us while we were inspecting some fine smelling roses nearby.  It was too late to run away, so instead we walked up to the security guard, and thanked him for finding us.  As they escorted us out, we complimented them on the great state of the garden, though that didn't seem to calm him down much.  He was far too frustrated with the situation.  As they were about to lead us out through the front gate, we offered to pay for our admission.  They rather sternly refused, and insisted we leave immediately, which we did.  \nAnd that's how Natalie and I got our free tour of the gardens, and took one step closer to falling in love.  Three years later, we were married."}

He set about to exterminate ½ the population of the galaxy. \n\nThanos did succeed and as the 2019 blockbuster Avengers : Endgame and subsequent TV shows suggested , there were some positive environmental benefits to a reduced population. The issue is , and without stating the obvious that genocide is wrong , is that even with a reduced population, that rate that which humans would repopulate the world in the next one hundred years,  as a consequence of such staggering loss, would be exponentially faster than the last hundred years. Thereby defeating Thanos, plan for resource management. Instead Thanos should have explored technology for maximizing the longevity of those resources or looked at more sustainable solutions."}

This is a recurring dream I have. I was right before the beginning of the exam and could not remember any of my classes of the year. On the way to the exam room I was asking all my friends to share their knowledge with me to catch up. I was  trying to locate my class book in my backpack in an attempt to read through it one last time as the class doors were getting closer and closer. My anxiety was raising. When the doors opened, instead of entering a classroom. , I stepped onto a meadow on a sunny afternoon. Very naturally my exam became a scavenger hunt to find pages of my book hidden in trees or floating on the lake. I was not surprised and quickly went about looking for a boat to retrieve the pages floating on the lake.  As I was on the boat I discovered I could float and even fly, which made it much easier to go after all the pages. Dreams are always interesting to remember.

{"instruction": "Why are dogs called dogs?", "input": "", "output": "About seven centuries ago, the word hound, which came from the Old English hund, was the word for all domestic canines. Dog was just used to refer to a subgroup of hounds that includes the lovely but frequently slobbering mastiff.\n\nOf course, the opposite is now true. We use dog to talk about all of man’s best friends, from lovable golden retrievers to panting chow chows. And hound is now used to indicate a type of dog used just for hunting. Hound especially refers to a dog with a long face and large, droopy ears. Linguists still speculate about the reversal of fortune for hound and dog. One idea suggests that the sub-breed known as dogs became so populous that dog simply became the generic term (sort of an animal equivalent of the way brand names can become so ubiquitous that they start to be used as a general term for their purpose)."}

{"instruction": "Why did the Soviet Union collapse?", "input": "", "output": "There are a multitude of reasons for the collapse of the Soviet Union.  But historians have generally narrowed it down to the following major causes:\n\nRise of ethnic nationalism in Soviet Republics:  After decades of suppressing national identities, ethnic groups began asserting their nationality and demanded greater autonomy and political power.  This resulted in numerous riots and protests throughout the Soviet Union with demands for independence and national self-determination. \n\nEconomic stagnation and fall of oil prices:  The centrally planned economic model resulted in massive shortages of staple consumer products.  Shops were continually empty and Soviet citizens needed to wait in long lines to purchase basic goods.  After years of economic deprivation, Soviet citizens were deeply angry at their government. In addition, oil prices declined significantly in the late 1980s, which provided the Soviet government a key source of hard currency.  This it made it difficult for the Soviet government to sustain high levels of military spending and keep the economy functioning. \n\nPerestroika and Glasnost: Gorbachev's reforms of the 1980s were intended to reinvigorate the Soviet economy.  However, they unintentionally triggered an opening of debate throughout the country.  The increased freedoms allowed people to more openly criticize the government and demand changes.  \n\nAfghanistan and Chernobyl: In the late 1980s, two events symbolized the incompetence of the Soviet government.  The failure of the Afghanistan war resulted in a loss of confidence in the Soviet military. The Chernobyl disaster revealed the incompetence and duplicity of the Soviet regime, resulting in a further erosion of trust."}

Make the case to a skeptical colleague as to why private sector managers should devote attention and energy to being a steward of the institutions of capitalism. Please include citations for Jonathan Haidt.", "input": "", "output": "To steward means to take care of, to guide, and it implies a sense of responsibility. I agree with \nthe notion that, in addition to stories about capitalism prevailing as either an extractor or savior, a third story can be written of “prosperity with problems” in which participants are grateful for \naccomplishments yet pursuing improvements (Haidt, J.) Putting that together, then, who is responsible for writing this story? I believe that answer to be business leaders themselves -- or else be beholden to government regulation to steward the institution in the direction that benefits not just owners and shareholders, but all stakeholders including employees and the environment.\n\nBut why should business leaders steward the market? Private managers hold a moral obligation to \nthose relying on capitalism for work and health insurance to create sustainable jobs. As individuals count on business leaders to respond to our world’s most prevalent issues, business leaders also hold a social obligation to do so with care. This response also assigns the appropriate accountability to \nwhomever is responsible for perpetuating a system – if business leaders want to reap the rewards of \nprofit, they must assume responsibility for the very conditions which benefit them.\n\nAs alluded to above, private interests sometimes conflict horribly with what society and individuals need, so government regulators must be \nstewards alongside business leaders. Additionally, business leaders can take a step away from their day-to-day and learn from those who have dedicated their lives to research."}

However, traditional agricultural practices have led to soil degradation and deforestation. Farmers in Ethiopia often rely on a few staple crops, such as teff, wheat, and maize, which are grown repeatedly on the same plot of land without proper rotation or replenishment of soil nutrients (International Labour Organization). This leads to reduced yields, which can make it difficult for farmers to produce enough food to feed their families and earn a living. Deforestation, which is also a major problem, has been driven by the need for more land to grow crops. Ethiopia has one of the highest deforestation rates in the world, with an estimated loss of 1.1 million hectares of forest every year (World Bank)."}

{"instruction": "What and how should you feed your baby?", "input": "", "output": "What to feed your baby depends on a number of factors ranging from their age, their health and your preferences. Typically, until your baby is 6 months old, their diet consists exclusively of breast milk or formula.  Around 6 months old your baby may be able to start solids. You should consult your physician before modifying the diet of your baby.  Some people choose to introduce solids with soft, mushy and simple foods like mashed bananas, avocados or rice cereal.  Others will introduce whatever food is being served to the adults — this could be complex foods with spices such as fajitas, curries and hamburgers. Although young babies will rarely have teeth, their gums are very hard and can mash food. For example, a common early food is mini cucumber, which also may alleviate pains with teething.  For how to feed your baby, there are two main categories with many variations in between 1/ Baby-led weaning 2/ Spoon fed. Baby-led does what it sounds like — the baby leads their own feeding. This is often done by the caregiver laying out a few foods (Soft, Mashable, Age-appropriate and safe — void of choking hazards) and letting the baby choose which foods to pick up and eat and how much.  Spoon-fed means the caregiver is selecting the foods and feeding the baby.  There is no right or wrong way to feed your baby. Consult a physician for tips and safety recommendations."}
{"instruction": "In golf, what is the proper technique when hitting a bunker shot? Assume the bunker is green adjacent.", "input": "", "output": "If the bunker is near the pin, use your sand-wedge.  Also, ensure you properly examined the green, to understand its shape and slope.  Combine this with an understanding of your own skill levels to make a decision on where you wish the ball to land.  For example,  the more skilled you are at these shots, the more precise a location you can identify.  Conversely, the less skilled you are, the less precise you can be in your chosen location, and consequently the more you need to consider a range of potential directions.  In those latter cases, it is best to aim towards the middle of the green rather than the exact placement of the pin.  Once you've made a decision on location, go up to your ball in the bunker.  (Pro-tip: don't forget to bring the rake with you).  Choose an open stance, where your legs are aiming roughly 45 degrees more to the left of the selected landing location.  If you're left-handed, the reverse is true, and your legs are aiming to the right of the intended direction/location.  Dig your shoes roughly an inch into the sand, to get a solid footing.  Next, bring your club face down to the ball, without actually touching the sand (it is not legal to make contact with the sand prior to contact with the ball).  Open the club face so that it aims towards the intended location.  Look one more time at the intended direction, then look down at the ball, and commence your backswing.  The plane of your backswing should be out, inline with the direction of your legs, and roughly three quarters the length of a full swing.  Firmly and confidently accelerate in your downswing, and aim to make contact with the sand roughly half an inch behind the ball.  The sand between the ball and the club head will blunt some of the force from the swing, thereby reducing ball travel distance, while still conveying spin.  A well hit shot can cause the ball to land on the green and immediately stop, possibly even moving back in the direction of the player.  The force in the downswing, combined with the amount of sand caught by the club head, are significant contributors to the amount of backspin on the ball.  Once you're done. rake up your marks as you exit the bunker, leaving no trace that you were ever there."}

Please develop your position into a one-page position paper (12-point font, single spaced).", "input": "", "output": "The Citizens United case is ultimately one pertaining to freedom of speech—while undeniable to US citizens, the protection of free speech was previously denied to unions and corporations. Now, they can express support or criticism of political candidates. This should be good news for both dominant political parties, as liberals tending to support unions and conservatives tending to laud free enterprise both have great voice in the election process. Concern, however, has been raised that companies now have too loud a voice.\nBut, who makes up companies? Individual humans, who are free to join and leave those companies at will. Why would a group of humans be devoid of any rights to which the individuals of the group are entitled? The constitutional right to free speech, it follows, applies to groups of individuals – which companies are – and those groups should be able to leverage their earned dollars to further promote their own well-being. And the ruling has legal precedent: dating back to 1868, US corporations have enjoyed equal protection under the 14th amendment and protection against search and seizure without warrant (Totenberg, N.)\nBut the decision cannot be analyzed solely through legal theory. What have the actual impacts been since the ruling? Rather than observing unlimited spending from corporations as feared, the last ten years have reemphasized the importance of low-level donors; instead of focusing power on just one party or candidate that certain corporations back, political parties have taken turns assuming power; corporate donations remain under 10% of total political spending at the federal level. Furthermore, it seems that wealthy individuals, rather than any specific union or corporation, have been making oversized donations that dominant the budgets of super-PACs. It follows that any concerns around voices dominating the political conversation are indeed individuals, not unions or corporations as fear.\nCitizens United allows companies to further act in their best interests and raise issues pertaining to the business. US citizens can and should be trusted to consume rhetoric intellectually, instead of shielded from the arguments companies are making."}

Words that are assigned to the same part of speech generally display similar syntactic behavior (they play similar roles within the grammatical structure of sentences), sometimes similar morphological behavior in that they undergo inflection for similar properties and even similar semantic behavior. Commonly listed English parts of speech are noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, preposition, conjunction, interjection, numeral, article, and determiner.\n\nAlmost all languages have the word classes noun and verb, but beyond these two there are significant variations among different languages. For example:\n\nJapanese has as many as three classes of adjectives, where English has one.\nChinese, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese have a class of nominal classifiers.\nMany languages do not distinguish between adjectives and adverbs, or between adjectives and verbs.\nBecause of such variation in the number of categories and their identifying properties, analysis of parts of speech must be done for each individual language.

{"instruction": "What makes a good teacher?", "input": "", "output": "Throughout history ‘what makes a good teacher?’ has constantly been questioned by both parents and children. Many consider a good teacher to be one who is caring, helpful, yet also strict when necessary. \n One book that focuses on what makes a good teacher is Our day out, by Willy Russel. The book provided people in the 1970s with a perspective on what both children and parents were looking for, inspiring many British teachers. According to Russel, a good teacher cares for the learning of their students and demonstrates it. If a teacher does not demonstrate caring behavior, their students will sense it. Carol, one of the students says to Mr.Briggs “Don't lie, you! I know you hate me. I've seen you goin' home in your car, passin' us on the street. You hate all the kids.” (Russell 48). Carol believes that Mr. Briggs does not care about his students, even though he does as shown earlier in the book: “Briggs: What? About you? Listen ... if I didn't care, why am I here, now, trying to stop you doing something stupid.” (Russell 48). Mr Briggs believes that caring for students implies also disciplining them at times. “Listen, I'm not going to spend any more time arguing with you. You may have organized this visit, but I'm the one who's been sent by the Headmaster to supervise. Now, either you take control of the children in your charge or I'll be forced to abandon this visit and order everyone home.” Thus, even if a teacher cares about their students, they should demonstrate it. Opinions from students of different ages will help further illustrate the image of a good teacher. \nMany people think that a good teacher is primarily kind and loving.  However, through multiple interviews it appeared to be only partially true. A good teacher, according to most students, is not overly kind and should apply discipline when needed. For example, 12 year old Monon Mukherjee said that he looks for guidance and ability to teach in a teacher. On the other hand, 40 year old Bilal Aslam looks for discipline and ability to teach. 42 year old Cristian Molina also agrees with the need for discipline, however he also expects teachers to feel an urge to help students no matter who they are. The book and the interviews intersect in many ways. They both highlight the importance of kindness, caring for learning, and teacher’s ability to discipline. However, they also differ in important ways. In the book, teachers were encouraged to be kind and apply discipline when necessary, but through the interviews it has been shown that providing help and guidance are also expected in a good teacher.\nIn conclusion, a good teacher cares about their students' learning, is prepared to help them, yet also disciplines them when necessary. A good teacher should feel an urge to teach students and guide them through the complex path of life."}

{"instruction": "what is Modern Talking?", "input": "", "output": "First formed in West Berlin in early 1983, they unexpectedly became popular in the beginning of 1985 with \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul\", with which they occupied top ten positions in 35 countries including their homeland where the single perched at the top for six consecutive weeks, the single eventually went on to sell eight million copies worldwide. The track was then followed by another number-one hit, \"You Can Win If You Want\", which was released in the middle of 1985 from the debut album The 1st Album. The album was certified platinum in Germany for selling over 500,000 units.\n\nSoon after their second hit, Modern Talking released the single \"Cheri, Cheri Lady\" which also quickly climbed to the top of the charts in West Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Norway, meanwhile entering the top ten in Sweden and the Netherlands. The single, being the only track released from their second album Let's Talk About Love, managed to push the album to a platinum status in West Germany for sales of over 500,000. The success continued with another two number one singles, \"Brother Louie\" and \"Atlantis Is Calling (S.O.S. for Love)\", both from the third album, Ready for Romance. The duo also charted high with their sixth single \"Geronimo's Cadillac\" from the fourth album In the Middle of Nowhere, and \"Jet Airliner\" from their fifth album Romantic Warriors.\n\nDue to their lackluster received sixth album, Bohlen announced the end of the project during an interview, while Anders was in Los Angeles. This sparked further animosities between the two, who had had a tumultuous and quarreling relationship even when they were together. According to Bohlen, the main reason for breaking up the group was Anders' then-wife Nora, who refused to have her husband interviewed by female reporters, and constantly demanded huge changes made to shows, videos or recordings, a fact that Anders later admitted in his biography. After a final phone call during which both men heavily insulted each other, they refused to speak with each other for over 10 years.\n\nDuring this era, Modern Talking were successful in Europe, Asia, South America, the Middle East and in Iran. In the United Kingdom, they entered the top five only once, with the song \"Brother Louie\". In 1985, RCA signed Modern Talking for a US deal and released their first album in the US, but they remained almost unknown in North America, never appearing on the US charts. They released two albums each year between 1985 and 1987, while also promoting their singles on television all over Europe, eventually selling sixty-five million records within three years.\n\nNotably, Modern Talking were one of the first Western bloc bands allowed to sell their records in the Soviet Union. After four decades of Cold War censorship and import restrictions, Mikhail Gorbachev's Glasnost reforms in 1986 opened the Soviet sphere to Western bands, including Modern Talking at the height of their popularity. As a result, they still maintain a large fanbase in Eastern Europe.\n\nBetween 1987 and 1997\nImmediately after the duo split in mid-1987, Bohlen formed his own project called Blue System and enjoyed several high chart positions, with tracks like \"Sorry Little Sarah\", \"My Bed Is Too Big\", \"Under My Skin\", \"Love Suite\", \"Laila\" and \"Déjà vu\". Meanwhile, Anders went solo, touring under the name of Modern Talking on several continents until the beginning of 1989, when he started to record some of his new pop-like material in LA and London, and also in his native country. Anders recorded five solo albums in English, Different, Whispers, Down on Sunset, When Will I See You Again and Souled, and one of his albums was also recorded in Spanish Barcos de Cristal. He was more successful in foreign countries than his own country, yet he also reached several hits in Germany. Despite all the quarrels and disagreements that Bohlen and Anders got into with each other in the past, they began staying in touch again after Anders moved back to Koblenz, Germany in 1994.\n\n1998–2003: Reunion\nIn the beginning of 1998, the duo reunited and had their first performance together in March on the German TV show Wetten, dass..?. They released a remixed version of their 1984 single \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul\", which features Eric Singleton on the rap vocals. Their first comeback album Back for Good, which included four new tracks, as well as all of the previous hits remixed with modern techniques, stayed at number one in Germany for five consecutive weeks and managed to top the charts in fifteen countries, eventually selling three million copies in Europe alone. The duo won the award for Best Selling German Band at the World Music Awards that year. The follow-up album Alone also went straight to number one in Germany and was very successful elsewhere; the album managed to sell over one million units in Europe alone.\n\nBohlen and Anders followed the 1980s Modern Talking pattern as they chose to release two singles from each album, as in the past. A series of singles and four more albums followed such as Year of the Dragon, America, Victory and Universe. After reaching the point where they had already collected over 400 gold and platinum awards worldwide, Bohlen and Anders decided to disband again in 2003 just before the release of another best-of compilation. The second break-up seemed to have been triggered mainly from the negative portrayal of Anders by Bohlen written in his autobiography published on 4 October 2003. In the course of all the disputes which eventually drove the duo to its break-up, Bohlen was involved in Deutschland sucht den Superstar (DSDS), the German edition of the UK's Pop Idol. The compilation album was released in 2003 entitled The Final Album which contained all of the duo's singles. Thomas Anders started another solo career immediately after the end of Modern Talking, while Bohlen had by now begun devoting most of his time to new talents, especially those he discovered on DSDS."}

{"instruction": "What is an aurora?", "input": "", "output": "An aurora, also commonly known as the polar lights, is a natural light display in Earth's sky, predominantly seen in high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic). Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.\n\nAuroras are the result of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by the solar wind. Major disturbances result from enhancements in the speed of the solar wind from coronal holes and coronal mass ejections. These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles in the magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere). The resulting ionisation and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying colour and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles."}

The pros are that the kids can stay connected with the family and friends when needed such as safety or security concerns. The mobile phones can also provide some useful educational resources (if used under supervision). Also kids can entertain themselves with a mobile device. Depending on the ages and also other more specific situations, mobile devices can also have very negative impact to their growth and well-being. For example kids may get addicted to video games and social media. Both can have very harmful contents if they are not being monitored carefully. Mobile phones can also easily distract children from their other tasks such as homework or sleep. Another important factor is safety. Mobile devices are subject to be exploited and hacked by bad actors and children are not mature nor knowledgable enough to be aware of this kind of dangers or risks. There are cases or incidents involving mobile devices that have caused young kids grave harms and serious consequences."}

They have attractive spiky foliage that is evergreen in many Zones and provide beautiful blooms multiple times a year.  They are cold hardy and are easily propagated and transplanted.\n\nThe best time of the year to transplant bearded iris is late summer.  This provides the plant with sufficient time to establish a new root structure before the winter.  Bearded iris grow from rhizomes, which quickly grow roots that provide the plant with the nutrients required to grow and form flowers.  The rhizomes should be removed from the soil using a garden fork making an attempt to keep as much root structure as possible.  The spiky leaves of the plant can be trimmed at this time to reduce the risk of the plant being disturbed by strong wind gusts when it is replanted.  Plant the rhizome in its new location so that only about a half of the rhizome is buried in the soil.  This enables the rhizome to receive direct sunlight and more vigorously replenish its stored starches and proteins."}

You are this carefree soul, who laughs out loud, makes weird faces and noises, showers loads of kisses and hugs, danced like no one is seeing, talked in a cute weird way, which only you and the audience would understand. \nOn a rainy day, everything you touch could go wrong. Your anger will see its waves. Your voice is commanding and demanding. Your eyes spew anger. Every action of yours is wrong till you sit and calm yourself and analyse what you are going through and why. \nAs much as you want to get it over, the more it will haunt you in your later years. You will long for those happy moments, those hugs and kisses, where everything under the sun was perfect and just like how you had envisioned, but it is all gone. Those are now just thoughts you keep revisiting, hoping you could time travel back to those golden days"}

At a high level, this can be split into two sections: \n    - Striking: Relevant marital arts you may want to consider training is Boxing, Kickboxing, Muai-Thai. \n    - Grappling: Relevant marital arts you may want to consider training in is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Sambo, Freestyle Wresting. \n\n3) Consider specializing: While it is good to have a breadth of different techniques, really honing in on one sub-discipline can give you an edge in comparison to other fighters.

{"instruction": "Is it wrong to split the infinitive?", "input": "", "output": "First, let's establish the meaning of a split infinitive. In simple terms the infinitive is the grammatical construct in which a verb is preceded by the word 'to': hence, 'to walk', 'to talk', 'to reason'. As a side-note, it's probably worth exploring whether the 'verbification' of nouns is a good thing: personally, I take issue with this and feel that examples such as 'to medal', meaning 'to win a medal at a sporting event', should never have been visited on the English language. But that's another discussion entirely. Returning to the infinitive, the split occurs when another word (usually an adverb) is placed between the word 'to' and its corresponding verb. Probably the most famous split infinitive occurs in the opening sequence of every episode of the classic and original TV show, Star Trek, with the lines:\n\"Space: The final frontier\nThese are the voyages of the Starship, Enterprise;\nIts five year mission:\nto explore strange new worlds;\nto seek out new life and new civilizations;\nto boldly go where no man has gone before.\"\nNote that final line: 'to boldly go'. Never has an infinitive been split so boldly before or since. Those who are grammatical pedants will have shuddered at this every time (and probably ended up preferring Star Wars to Star Trek as a consequence) but through those original seventy-nine episodes and their many repeat showings, the split infinitive has subtly embedded itself in our lexicon. \nSo, to return to the question, is it wrong to split the infinitive? Since language is constantly evolving, influenced by the whims and practices of each generation, the answer must be 'no'. On the whole sentences tend to flow more freely and with greater elan if infinitives aren't split and pesky adverbs are kept in their place either before or after ('to go boldly' or 'boldly to go') but sometimes one has to admit that splitting works, and we should be thankful for the colour that brings to the language we hear daily. Who nowadays wouldn't want to boldly go?"}

{"instruction": "Who are the best chess players of all time?", "input": "", "output": "It's difficult to determine who the best chess players of all time are as there are a variety of factors to consider when determining chess strength.

Bobby Fischer is well-known for winning the \"Game of the Century\" at the age of 13 and, as an adult, won 20 consecutive games against some of the best chess players in the world. Gary Kasparov was the number one rated chess player for over 20 years and was World Chess Champion for 15 consecutive years.

A versatile and well-rounded attacker, from a tactical standpoint, Ibrahimović is capable of playing anywhere along the front line, due to his ability to both create and score goals for his team, although he is most often deployed as a striker, due to his composure and eye for goal. He has also functioned in a more creative playmaking role at times, as a supporting forward or even as a number 10, in particular in his later career, after losing some of his pace and stamina with age; this deeper position allows him to drop into midfield to pick up the ball, where he can utilize his technical ability, vision, passing, and movement to create space and provide assists for teammates. While naturally right-footed, Ibrahimović is a powerful and accurate striker of the ball from both inside or outside the penalty area with either foot, and is also known for his accuracy from penalties and dead ball situations. An accurate finisher with his head as well as with his feet, his height, elevation, and strength often give him an advantage at winning aerial challenges, and also allow him to function as a \"target man\"; despite his large stature, Ibrahimović is uncommonly agile for a player of his size, and his athleticism and ability in the air have seen him score several goals from acrobatic strikes and volleys throughout his career, which earned him the moniker Ibracadabra in the Italian media. In spite of his size and physique, Ibrahimović possesses excellent technique and ball control, which, coupled with his balance, power, and physicality, enables him to hold up the ball well with his back to goal, retain possession, and link up with other players; he has also been praised by pundits for his creativity and dribbling skills. Although he is not gifted with exceptional pace, in particular over shorter distances, which became more evident in his later career as he slowed down with age, he is also a quick player and a fast sprinter, who possessed significant acceleration in his youth, and was able to clock top speeds over 30 km/h even into his 30s."}

{"instruction": "What is retail banking?", "input": "", "output": "Retail banking, also known as consumer banking or personal banking, is the provision of services by a bank to the general public, rather than to companies, corporations or other banks, which are often described as wholesale banking. Banking services which are regarded as retail include provision of savings and transactional accounts, mortgages, personal loans, debit cards, and credit cards. Retail banking is also distinguished from investment banking or commercial banking. It may also refer to a division or department of a bank which deals with individual customers.\n\nIn the U.S., the term commercial bank is used for a normal bank to distinguish it from an investment bank. After the Great Depression, the Glass–Steagall Act restricted normal banks to banking activities, and investment banks to capital market activities. That distinction was repealed in the 1990s. Commercial bank can also refer to a bank or a division of a bank that deals mostly with deposits and loans from corporations or large businesses, as opposed to individual members of the public (retail banking)."}
{"instruction": "Give me a one line summary of the story below: \n\nA long long time ago the Queen of Odisha heard that there was a master stone sculptor who made such stunning statues of the gods that people would weep from happiness at the beauty of the statues if they saw them. One summer day, while resting indolently with the King in the main hall of the royal palace, the Queen suddenly had a thought. \"How nice it would be, King, if we could build some beautiful statutes of Lord Jagannath so that the people can come worship Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subadhra. What do you think?\" \n\nThe King thought for a few minutes, and then nodded in agreement. \"What do you have in mind, my Queen?\" And so, soon the stone sculptor was summoned to appear before the Court for an appointment to build in his way the statutes of the gods. Soon the monsoon season started and the sculptor appeared in front of the court, awaiting his appointment. He was a humble man from the mountainous regions of Odisha. Even at his best-dressed, one couldn't help but notice his rough hands, and the small sprinkling of dust that seemed ever present in his hair. \n\nThe King and Queen graciously waited as the sculptor bowed and then asked \"Your majesties, what can I do for you?\" The Queen leaned forward in her throne and her voice rang out in the court \"We have heard, o Master Sculptor, of your skills from people far and wide across the Kingdom. We dream of having you put your skills to use to build beautiful statues that will represent Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra for our people to worship.\"\n\nThe sculptor was silent. As his silence extended, ministers of the court began to feel restless. \"Speak up! How can you be silent when the Queen graces you so!\" But still, the sculptor was silent. \n\nThe King and Queen sat patiently in their thrones as they waited for the sculptor to respond. Perhaps the enormity of the task was too much. Perhaps, the sculptor was thinking of what he should ask for in return. Or even more, perhaps, the sculptor was awed and honored by the request. \n\nAt last, as the shadows from the late afternoon sun began to stretch across the floors of the hall, the sculptor shifted his weight, and opened his mouth to speak. \"Your majesties, you grace me with such a request, I cannot help but oblige. It is an honor.\" At this, the Queen sat as straight as a rod, listening for the words that would come next. \"But, I can do this on one condition only. I will work in a closed hall, where none may enter - regardless of whether they can hear me working or otherwise. None may enter until I open the doors from within and proclaim to all that the statues are completed.\"\n\nThe ministers gasped - what a strange request from this man. Was he a fool? What if he just slept and ate and didn't do any work? How could the King and Queen trust that he would do the work he was promising to do? The Queen looked on thoughtfully. She glanced at the King, and it seemed to her that he agreed on this condition without reservation. She looked at the sculptor and then nodded her assent. \"We decree that you shall build these statues in a hall set aside, into which no one shall enter until your work is complete and you proclaim that to us after opening the doors of the hall from within.\"", "input": "", "output": "The Queen of Odisha invites a master stone sculptor to build statutes to the gods, Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subhadra, with the promise that no one will disturb the sculptor until the sculptor finishes the statues and tells everyone that he has finished the statues."}

{"instruction": "What is the objective of a batter in the sport of baseball?", "input": "", "output": "The principal objective of the batting team in the sport of baseball is to have a player reach first base safely; this generally occurs either when the batter hits the ball and reaches first base before an opponent retrieves the ball and touches the base, or when the pitcher persists in throwing the ball out of the batter's reach. Players on the batting team who reach first base without being called \"out\" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners \"out\", which forces them out of the field of play. The pitcher can get the batter out by throwing three pitches which result in strikes, while fielders can get the batter out by catching a batted ball before it touches the ground, and can get a runner out by tagging them with the ball while the runner is not touching a base."}

{"instruction": "How do Nietzsche and Haraway critique the concept of scientific knowledge and its pursuit of objectivity? How do they use the ideas of \"the god-trick\" and \"pride\" to explain the faults in scientific discoveries?", "input": "", "output": "In Nietzsche’s, “On the Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense” Nietzsche explains his attitude towards human scientific knowledge with great skepticism, even alluding to humans as “the most arrogant and mendacious” creations (On Truth and Lying in an Extra-Moral Sense, 7). This same sort of criticism is brought up in the concept of “the god-trick” in Haraway’s, “Situated Knowledge: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective.” Haraway explains this concept as an illusion within which humans compare their own knowledge to the idea of infinite knowledge to that of a god. This sort of intellectual superiority has been a long-standing concept in human history as we have progressed in scientific thought. Described initially in Haraway’s writing, “the god-trick” remerges in many ideas Nietzsche exemplifies this through various metaphors and explanations of biases through perceptions.\nThis idea of the “the god-trick” and its qualities of knowing all, stem from humans and their rigid minds, being able to grasp only at what is tangible in their own minds, consequently shutting out other perspectives. Humans approach scientific discovery with a biased view, through their own one-sided viewpoint, and through no fault of their own make scientific discoveries which come from their own observations. But it isn't at this point where human faults are exemplified, Nietzsche argues, rather when scientific discovery is built upon these so-called\n “scientific truths.” It is at this point in time where in a moment notice the concept of science could “swell up like a balloon at the slightest puff” because of the very construct of scientific advancement based on falsities (On Truth and Lying in an Extra-Moral Sense, 7). Yet, given the knowledge of how fallible so many human discoveries have the potential to be, we still hold on to the idea of superior credibility which can be challenged by no force in our world, in essence, what Haraway refers to. In her idea of the “the god-trick,” Haraway advocates for a different way we approach observations through a different approach to objectivity. In separating ourselves from the almost seemingly personal obligation of being able to understand anything and everything and accepting the complexities of science we are able to remove the idea of false compromise on scientific truths to make up for our lack of understanding.\nA fundamental idea that is exemplified in Nietzsche’s writing, is the idea of pride. Pride is a large component of human behavior and many actions are justified. The concept of pride can even be seen as an answer to the implied questions of where the root of the “god-trick” is derived from. From the beginning of time, it can be observed that we humans have had an itch for the idea of conquering. An itch to conquer societies, cultures, land, or even something as simple as higher socioeconomic status. It's quite simply in our blood and has been present for generations of humans. Furthering Haraway’s argument, Nietzsche presents the idea of how being prideful in the depth of our “knowledgeable” we are “blinding fog over the eyes and senses of men'' exemplifying how pride can produce scientific thought that provides answers just for the sake of answering questions that in reality are faulty (On Truth and Lying in an Extra-Moral Sense, 7). As a result of this, a curtain of deception is created in which humans have assisted in the creation\n\nof their lies which to them have been converted into truth. Scientific discovery from this point on leads to “truth” being built upon from lies.\nTurning a blind eye is a large theme within the idea of “the god-trick” and is iterated upon in Nietzsche’s description of the “leaf.” The leaf is a broad example of this created by “disregarding... differences and forgetting distinguishing aspects” (On Truth and Lying in an Extra-Moral Sense, 24). What is described here is that humans cannot label an \"essential quality\" for anything they describe. In essence, it is understood that there are many different types of leaves but we are not able to explain the explicit differences among them and in doing so what arises is a lack of “truth'' with the leaf. The fault lies in the generalization of the leaf and applying this generalization to other contexts is where the fault lies, which is exactly what Haraway addresses in her “god-trick” illusion. The very definition of “the god-trick” includes generalizing our own knowledge to compensate for the holes in our discovery and knowledge.\nThrough years of scientific advancement and gain in understanding our world, the so-called truths that humans have established may have faults resulting from the way the scientific method approaches them. Haraway suggests that our way of utilizing objectivity needs to reworked to be more inclusive and Nietzsche’s writings extend upon this idea and exemplify how these truths may have fault in them as a result of assumptions. These assumptions built on top of each other lead to the lack of understanding that both authors argue."}

{"instruction": "How Should I train my dog?", "input": "", "output": "10 years ago the very common approach to dog training was the \"Alpha\" approach, also known as dominance training.  This approach focuses on building a pack structure in the home where the humans are seen as higher in the pecking order than the dogs in the home.  Examples include leading at all times (ie through doorways and walks), and only allowing your dog to eat after you’ve finished dinner and using training aids like a shock/vibration collar to enforce behaviors. \n\nIn recent years, many experts have recommended a positive reinforcement based training approach.  Although there are a lot of nuances, at its core this method uses rewards to guide your dog towards desired behaviors. Positive reinforcement training typically means using a signal (like a word or a noise) combined with training treats, loved toys or verbal praise to reinforce good behaviors or actions. Other benefits include strengthening the relationship between owner and dog and building a happy training environment."}

In cities, the driving pace can vary between slow and fast speeds, and one needs to be extra attentive. Other vehicles may switch lanes hastily without indicating, or break with no warning. In some cities, one also has trams to be aware of. Pedestrians, bicyclists, and other electric mobility vehicles might appear unexpectedly in traffic. Another thing to take note of is the time of day, and day of the week, as traffic jams can occur when too many people are in traffic at the same time. In some situations, it might be faster to walk, cycle, or take public transportation than drive in cities. Finally, parking and tolls might be expensive when there is a lot of traffic, yet free when cities tend to be empty."}

I am aware that having a pet is a huge commitment so I am writing to you to explain why I think you should buy me a pet tortoise and why a tortoise is a fantastic choice of pet.\n\nLooking after a pet tortoise will give me a strong sense of responsibility. I know that I will have to ensure my tortoise is well fed, kept at the right temperature, given opportunities to bask under a heated lamp or in the sunshine if warm enough. I am very willing to give the time and commitment necessary to look after my tortoise. The tortoise will be my sole responsibility and I feel mature enough to commit to its care and happiness.\n\nAs you know, I suffer from anxiety and school makes me particularly worried sometimes. It has been shown through numerous studies that pets reduce anxiety and stress in humans. I feel sure that having a tortoise will be a fantastic distraction from my worries and bring me great enjoyment. Contrary to popular belief, tortoises love having their shells stroked and their chins tickled and I think it would be very relaxing for me to pet a tortoise when I get home from school.\n\nTortoises are very self-sufficient. Provided they are given a warm place to bask, access to fresh water and plenty of fresh food such as dandelions, kale, lettuce and other leafy vegetables, they are very happy to be left to their own devices. As we live in the UK where temperatures can be cool, we would need to purchase a tortoise table with good substrate, a basking lamp and some hides where the tortoise can tuck itself away. We have lots of space for this in our kitchen. When it is warm, the tortoise can go into our garden in an enclosure. A tortoise table and lamp will cost about £200 but this is just an initial outlay. Thereafter, keeping a tortoise is very cheap. In fact, you can pick most of their food for free by foraging which I am happy to do when we go for families walk.\n\nContrary to popular belief, tortoises can be very friendly. As I have mentioned above, they love being stroked but did you also know that they can recognise their owners and some can even respond to their names? In fact, a study showed that tortoises can recognise their previous owners that they haven’t seen in years so they are both friendly and very intelligent.\nYou might be worried about hibernating a tortoise but I have done lots of research on this and now know exactly what to do. If we buy a tortoise, it will need to hibernate for a maximum of three months from the end of September. We will need to hibernate our tortoise in a well-insulated box. The temperature mustn’t go above or below 5 degrees celsius and our garage would be the perfect place for it. We have a temperature gauge in there so I can keep an eye on the heat levels. \n\nFinally, I have looked into the cost of buying a tortoise. I would suggest we buy a tortoise which is a couple of years’ old as they require less care. We can buy a preloved tortoise which has been microchipped for about £100. And when we go on holiday, I have found a Tortoise Hotel which is run by a vet and costs just £60 for a 10 day stay.\n\nI think you will agree that I have conducted very thorough research into looking after a tortoise and I hope you will agree that I am now mature enough to look after a pet. I truly believe that a pet tortoise will give me a strong sense of responsibility and will have a positive calming effect on my mood. Indeed, I think the whole family will enjoy having a tortoise. They are friendly, loving, interesting and intelligent animals and we will all benefit from having one.\n\nI would be grateful if you would give my request full consideration.\n\nLots of Love,\n\nWilf x"}

It expands on the concept of disruptive technologies, a term he coined in a 1995 article \"Disruptive Technologies: Catching the Wave\". It describes how large incumbent companies lose market share by listening to their customers and providing what appears to be the highest-value products, but new companies that serve low-value customers with poorly developed technology can improve that technology incrementally until it is good enough to quickly take market share from established business. Christensen recommends that large companies maintain small, nimble divisions that attempt to replicate this phenomenon internally to avoid being blindsided and overtaken by startup competitors."}

{"instruction": "When do avalanches occur?", "input": "", "output": "Avalanches are primarily caused by unstable snow conditions. Although a mountainside covered in snow might appear as a uniform surface, it is actually made up of many layers of snow from different storms, each of which might have very different compositions. For example, a \"dry\" snow from a very cold storm might land directly on top of a sun-baked layer which turned to ice. The point at which these layers meet is called an interface, and is where slipping or sliding of one layer on top of another is most likely to occur. This occurrence is what can trigger an avalanche. Snow conditions on a slope can also evolve over time with wind and sun and other weather patterns, so even a once-safe slope might increase in risk under certain conditions. People recreating in the outdoors in the winter can benefit from learning about these situations from avalanche professionals."}

{"instruction": "Why are people eating eggs at Easter", "input": "", "output": "Easter eggs, also called Paschal eggs, are eggs that are decorated for the Christian feast of Easter, which celebrates the resurrection of Jesus. As such, Easter eggs are common during the season of Eastertide (Easter season). The oldest tradition, which continues to be used in Central and Eastern Europe, is to use dyed and painted chicken eggs.\n\nAlthough eggs, in general, were a traditional symbol of fertility and rebirth, in Christianity, for the celebration of Eastertide, Easter eggs symbolize the empty tomb of Jesus, from which Jesus was resurrected. In addition, one ancient tradition was the staining of Easter eggs with the colour red \"in memory of the blood of Christ, shed as at that time of his crucifixion.\"\n\nThis custom of the Easter egg, according to many sources, can be traced to early Christians of Mesopotamia, and from there it spread into Eastern Europe and Siberia through the Orthodox Churches, and later into Europe through the Catholic and Protestant Churches. Mediaevalist scholars normally conclude that the custom of Easter eggs has its roots in the prohibition of eggs during Lent after which, on Easter, they have been blessed for the occasion.\n\nA modern custom in some places is to substitute chocolate eggs wrapped in coloured foil, hand-carved wooden eggs, or plastic eggs filled with confectionery such as chocolate."}

{"instruction": "In football, if touchdowns is the main way to get points, why can't the quarterback always throw the ball to the end zone every time?", "input": "", "output": "To win at the game of American football, points are scored by touchdowns and kicking field goals, primarily. \nAt a simplistic level, it might appear that throwing the ball to the end zone at every opportunity is the straight forward strategy. \n\nHowever, if one did that, then the defense would adjust and accordingly defend. Also, typically the team has to move the ball 75 to 80 yards to the end zone. Only a few strong armed quarterbacks can throw that far. Even fewer can do it under pressure. The other main issue is that there is a very low chance of completing the pass. \n\nSo, smart teams and coaches, use a variety of strategies of both throwing the ball different distances, running the ball, and based on distance, kicking field goals. One of the key strategies is to mix it up, so that there is an element of surprise and the defense is caught off-guard."}

However, neither where coffee was first cultivated nor direct evidence of its consumption prior to the 15th century have been found. Sufi monasteries in Yemen employed coffee as an aid to concentration during prayers. Coffee later spread to the Levant and Persia in the early 16th century; it caused some controversy on whether it was halal in Ottoman and Mamluk society. Coffee arrived in Italy the second half of the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade routes, while Central and Eastern Europeans learnt of coffee from the Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the East Indies. Coffee houses would establish themselves in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in England and Germany. One of the earliest cultivations of coffee in the New World was when Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720. These beans later sprouted 18,680 coffee trees which enabled its spread to other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue and also to Mexico. By 1788, Saint-Domingue supplied half the world's coffee. By 1852, globally, Brazil became the largest producer of coffee and has held that status ever since. The period since 1950 saw the widening of the playing field due to the emergence of several other major producers, notably Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam; the latter overtook Colombia and became the second-largest producer in 1999. Modern production techniques along with the mass productization of coffee has made it a household item today."}

{"instruction": "Why does the US Federal Reserve raise interest rates?", "input": "", "output": "One of the primary roles of the US Federal Reserve is to control the supply of money within the economy.  During times when the economy is doing incredibly well, a.k.a. running hot or facing inflation (rise of prices of goods and services), the Federal Reserve will need to reduce the supply of money by increasing the cost of borrowing.  \n\nThe primary lever to increase the cost of borrowing is by increasing the Federal Funds rate (the rate for banks to borrow and lend their excess reserves to meet liquidity requirements). Increasing the Federal Funds rate results in more expensive borrowing costs, which can reduce demand among banks to borrow money.  Less money is borrowed to help fund the economy resulting in a reduction in purchasing power and the money supply.  This will slow down the pace of economic growth and help ease inflation."}

They are easy to train and known for spending most of their day sleeping, this is also a very quiet breed that doesn't have a lot of complains of barking.\nIs that something you would permit? \nI am also happy to hop on a call or meet in person to discuss further in case you have any follow-up questions.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nKind regards"}

{"instruction": "Explain me the concept of \"Karma\" in Buddhism.", "input": "", "output": "Karma is one of the most misunderstood aspects of Buddhism. In simple terms, Karma is the law of action and reactions. Our actions, both physical and thoughts, are the acts that are put in the world. Reactions can be referred to as their manifestations in the actor's life, i.e. our own life. For example, suppose your mind is filled with greed, evil thoughts like harming another person, and jealousy. In that case, it reflects restlessness as we will never be satisfied, punishments for harming another person, and stress to become like someone else, respectively. For a positive example, a life lived with generosity, righteousness, kindness, and genuinely putting good out there will lead to respect in society and a fulfilled life. Furthermore, Buddhism believes in reincarnation. So the good acts and deeds that one puts in this life, one also reaps the benefits in the next life. Therefore, the equation of Karma is relatively straightforward. Do good and work for the betterment of society and oneself."}

{"instruction": "Is there a correlation between the milestones required between Data AI/ML and Intelligent Automation (RPA) value curve over time?", "input": "", "output": "For organizations to achieve the most value from their data, they must establish a data foundation that allows for high-quality reporting on past events. Establishing a Databrick’s Lakehouse foundation requires no AI/ML capabilities. Then, over time, use that data AI/ML to drive automated decisions for crucial business processes.  For this reason, there is a direct correlation between the “value curve” for both data and intelligent automation. \nThe value maturity curve for intelligent automation starts with basic, attended, or unattended automation that mimics basic human processes today. Then, as you mature your Robotic Process Automation (RPA) program, your automation(s) need to expand to include simple document understanding AI.  Extracting data from the same form hundreds or thousands of times is a good example. Finally, for any organization to gain the highest value and ROI for their intelligent automation investments, using complex AI/ML to produce automated decisions for digital workers (unattended automation) enables exceptionally complex, long-running automation to be successfully developed, put into production, and maintained over time.\n\nIn summary, think of “AI/ML” as the thinking and “Intelligent Automation” as the doing. The value of both Data and RPA to any organization grows exponentially over time as they develop their ability to apply to complex AI/ML such that those models deliver trusted automated decisions to the digital workforce running complex automation."}

The basic stopping mechanism is something called a pizza-pie or wedge move.  The tips of the skis are positioned together (barely touching) with the back of the skis much further apart.  As far apart as the persons hips or even further.  The further apart the back of the skis are the slower the person will go to the point of stopping.   The trainer should both describe and demonstrate this position to the trainee.  The trainee will copy the position with feedback and adjustments from the trainer.  Practicing this formation should be done many times until the trainee is comfortable stopping on steep slopes.  Once this effort is mastered, the trainee can move to the next steps in learning how to ski."}

You are paying for the quality as well as the unique custom design. \nAsian wedding clothes are normally the most expensive. Some high end brands use gold and silver threads to make the wedding day dress even more prestigious. An average wedding dress can cost from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars."}

{"instruction": "Why did Christopher Columbus think he had sailed to Asia instead of America? What maps did he have at his disposal?", "input": "", "output": "The reason behind Columbus' belief that he had reached Asia is depicted on a map of the Atlantic Ocean from 1474, created by Florentine mathematician, astronomer, and cosmographer Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli. This map was later included in a literary and historical atlas of America by Bartholomew in 1884, with light blue areas marking regions that were not originally present on the map.\n\nToscanelli served as an inspiration for Columbus, who received a letter from him on June 25, 1474. The letter was sent to canon Fernam Martins in Lisbon, who consulted Toscanelli on behalf of King Alfonso V about the possibility of reaching India through a western route.\n\nThe map clearly shows that Columbus was both inspired and misguided by Toscanelli's plan, which underestimated the Earth's circumference. This miscalculation led Columbus to believe that he had reached Japan instead of a completely new and unfamiliar continent lying between Europe and Asia.\n\nToscanelli's proposed plan involved sailing west along the equator to reach India and the wealthy countries of East Asia. The map that Toscanelli enclosed, which is now lost, included the western fringes of Europe and Africa, as well as the eastern fringes of Asia, with the Atlantic Ocean in between. However, Toscanelli mistakenly believed that the distance was only one-third of the Earth's circumference, far less than the actual distance.\n\nIn a letter, Toscanelli writes, among other things:\n\nI have already spoken once before of a route across the sea to the land of spices, much shorter than that of the Portuguese across Guinea. That is why His Highness the King is now asking me for information on this subject, or rather for an explanation so clear that even people without any scientific background can understand that this path must exist. Although I know that it has its basis in the spherical shape of the earth, I have nevertheless, in order to make myself better understood and facilitate the project, decided to prove that such a route exists by means of a specially constructed sea chart. I am therefore sending his highness a map drawn by myself, on which I have marked the coasts and islands which can be used as points of departure when one undertakes such a journey and on this journey keeps a steady westerly course"}

Melodies in middle eastern music are generally long, lack harmony, and have unfamiliar pitches.\n\nMiddle Eastern music typically sounds monophonic, meaning it's solely based on one or more instruments that play a single melody with a different variation. Western music typically sounds polyphonic, meaning more than one layer of melody is being played simultaneously.\n\nWestern music has twelve notes per octave including seven whole notes and five half-notes. However middle eastern music is based on different scale systems. It has quarter notes in addition and various regions have a different number of notes in their octave system.\n\nWestern music has harmony (ie. chords) while middle eastern music does not. In middle eastern music, there is only one melodic line with rise and fall. So the purity of the melodic line and the complexity of the rhythm is what make two different songs apart. In contrast, western music has a structure with a beginning, middle, and end."}

Research in the field of positive psychology has shown that simply being in/around nature can improve one's sense of well-being. Being able to exercise while feeling the sun on your back, hearing the birds chirp, and seeing people play around in the sand is a totally different experience than being stuck inside a dark building. Additionally, playing volleyball in the sand is way more difficult and a harder workout than playing on a court. In order to jump the same height or run after a shanked ball, you have to exert more energy. Since exercise is known to release endorphins, one could argue that more endorphins are released when playing beach volleyball over indoor. Overall, beach volleyball is more fun and a better workout than indoor volleyball."}

Despite causing many people to feel stressed or pressured, competition is beneficial for challenging oneself, but it must be utilized properly.\nA common habitat of competition is in sports. Whether it be competing against another person, another team, or against time, sports push people to work harder, faster, and stronger. This athletic competition is good, because it is mutually beneficial for both parties. Both and all players are challenged physically, and thats are taught both the importance and, if they succeed, the rewards of hard work.\nCompetition in sports is expected, However, the misuse of competitiveness has become common in academics. While competition in sports is expected, academics is meant to be more reflective. Competition between students for the highest marks can be good, as both will challenge each other, but often makes other students feel belittled and unworthy. Grades in particular are a measure of self-knowledge and hard work and should not be used to compare one student to another. This is where and how competition is often misused and its intentions misunderstood.\nOften this misused competition comes from pressure from peers, parents, and sometimes teachers. A common example is competition between siblings stimulated by parents: comparing the childrens looks, academie abilities, athleticism, and social awareness. This kind of abusive competition is more likely to create anxiety, insecurity, and depression for both siblings, revealing perhaps the most important condition for healthy competition: it has to come from yourself.\nAlmost all negative experiences with competition stem from society around us, leading many to believe that the correct thing to do is compare students, siblings. children, employees, and more. But competition's true purpose is to inspiles oneself to work hard and take on new challenges. \"Forced\" competition doesn't allow a person to be in control of their goals. This is why Kohn felt \"caught on a treadmill,\" when being compared to others. The competition comes from within and motivates one to set, work for, and reach new goals.\nTo prevent unhealthy competition, people should try to be more vocal about their goals and expectations about themselves. Encouragement, of course, is always nice so voicing your wishes is important. If parents, teachers, or bosses know what you expect from yourself. they can better encourage, support, and challenge you."}

{"instruction": "Why are there so many rules about table manners?", "input": "", "output": "Well one big reason is that eating among other people is a social activity. In any social activity, there are guidelines for behavior. Mostly these guidelines are intended to make the social activity pleasant or fun for all the people involved. \nFor table manners, the rules are noticeably different among different cultures. Still, there are some common themes across cultures, for what is considered polite manners while eating. One common theme is to ensure that every person at the meal gets to eat. You can see this in the American table manner rule that nobody should not start eating until every person has been served their meal. In Mexican culture, any child who is nearby an outdoor party should be offered some of the party food. Another common theme about manners is that you should enjoy the food and the company, and not appear to simply be gobbling down as much food as possible. There are a lot of negative words to describe behavior that looks like eating too much or too fast, to be considered polite: being piggish, wolfing your food, gobbling, scarfing. \nOne rule that helps enforce slow eating, in American table manners, is that you shouldn't butter a whole piece of bread before eating it. Instead, you should tear the bread into smaller pieces, and butter only the piece you will eat next. Breaking the bread in half is considered a minimum level of politeness. Also, it's considered polite to leave one bite of each dish on your plate. If you eat everything, it could signal that you were just hungry, and eating everything available! But if you leave one bite, it signals \"I liked it, but had enough\". Americans also slow down eating by using both their fork and their knife in their right hands. This means that whenever you need to cut your food, you have to put down your fork, pick it up in your left hand, and pick up your knife in your right hand to cut your food. Before taking the bite, you have to do the opposite: put down your knife, pick up your fork in your right hand, and take your bite. This slows down eating a lot. (This rule is in contrast to table manners for the English, who keep their fork in their left hand and their knife in their right hand). Also, when eating soup, it's polite to push the spoon away from you, after filling it. Wipe the bottom of the spoon on the far side of your bowl, before bringing the spoonful of soup to your mouth. If you eat soup this way, you avoid scooping spoonfuls directly into your mouth -- which again, could look like you are just wolfing down food as fast as possible, instead of enjoying each mouthful.\nThere are also some table manner rules that provide signals to the servers or the waitstaff, without requiring verbal communications. For example, if you put down your fork pointing at 4:00 (with the handle pointing to the lower right of your plate), then it communicates \"I'm still eating\". But if you put your fork down, pointing at 10:00 or 11:00, then it communicates \"I'm finished with this food\". Then your server can take away your plate without interrupting the group conversation, which again is an example of making the social activity more pleasant for the participants. \nOverall, the rules of table manners evolved to make the social experience of eating a meal together a pleasant experience for everyone."}

Animal products like chicken and beef are the easiest ways of consuming whole protein. Animal byproducts like cheese, eggs, cottage cheese, and greek yogurt are a great way to supplement protein intake, as long as you are keeping an eye out for fat, cholesterol and sugar, which can sometimes come in large amounts in those products. Topping your meals with high-protein nuts like almonds or pistachios is a clever and sneaky way of getting some extra protein in your food. If you still aren't getting enough protein in your diet, you can supplement with a protein shake. This is a great option for people that don't consume animal products, as many protein powders are plant-based. Other plant-based proteins sources are tofu, legumes, quinoa and edamame."}

{"instruction": "How do you cook the perfect pizza?", "input": "", "output": "The first thing you must do is preheat your oven up as high as it will go. It takes longer than you think to heat your oven up all the way! You want to give your oven at least 30 minutes to preheat. If you have a pizza stone, make sure it’s inside the preheating oven.\nFor highend ovens, this can be up to 550 degrees F. For regular ovens, they are not going above 475 F. Pizza is traditionally cooked in 900 or 1,000 degree ovens. We can’t get our ovens at home quite that hot, but we want to get as close as we can. Figure out what your oven can do and crank up the heat.\nStart out with about 12-16 ounces of dough. Any pizza dough, homemade or store bought, will work for this recipe.\nPlace your ball of dough in the center of your work surface and use your hands to press it down, starting from the center. Keep gently patting out the dough, moving the dough outward from the center. I like to leave a pretty healthy crust on the edges of my dough.\nContinue patting and stretching the dough gently with your hands until it is about 12 inches across. Of course you can use a rolling pin if you want! (Use your hands to lift up the edges of the pizza when you are done to get more a lip for the crust.)\nAt this point, transfer the dough to a square of parchment paper. I highly recommend using parchment paper because it’s SO much easier transferring your pizza into the oven.\nStretch and arrange the dough on the parchment paper. The dough shrinks a bit when you pick it up to transfer, just gently stretch it out again.\nDrizzle a bit of olive oil over the top of your dough. Use your hands or a pastry brush to rub the oil all over the top of the dough, especially the edges of the crust. This layer of oil helps the toppings stay separate from the dough, helping it cook more evenly. It also tastes delicious, especially on your crust. \nOnce the oven is up to temperature, we are going to do a 1 to 2 minute par bake.\nSome of my favorite pizza toppings:\nJust Cheese: Any will work: Mozzarella, Fontina, Parmesan, and Gorgonzola would be amazing.\nPepperoni\nMeat Lovers: Pepperoni, salami, Italian sausage, ham, bacon\nHawaiian: Canadian bacon, pineapple\nMargherita: fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, tomatoes\nBBQ: Use barbecue sauce instead of tomato sauce, then rotisserie chicken, red onions, bacon\nVeggie pizza: spinach, tomato, corn, peppers, red onion, mushrooms\nBuffalo: Use Frank’s sauce instead of tomato sauce, then add rotisserie chicken, garlic, blue cheese, red onions\nOnce your pizza is in the oven, you need to cook it for about 8-12 minutes. This is of course going to depend on how hot your oven is, and how thick your pizza is. The crust should be golden brown, and the cheese should be bubbly and also starting to brown. If you don’t have a pizza stone, use a spatula to lift the edge of your pizza to make sure that it is browning all across the center on bottom. If the bottom is still white, you are looking at a doughy pizza. Leave it in longer."}

Economists believe that an efficient national payment system reduces the cost of exchanging goods and services, and is indispensable to the functioning of the interbank, money, and capital markets. A weak payment system may severely drag on the stability and developmental capacity of a national economy; its failures can result in inefficient use of financial resources, inequitable risk-sharing among agents, actual losses for participants, and loss of confidence in the financial system and in the very use of money."}

{"instruction": "What is molecular biology?", "input": "", "output": "Molecular biology is the branch of biology that seeks to understand the molecular basis of biological activity in and between cells, including biomolecular synthesis, modification, mechanisms, and interactions.[ The study of chemical and physical structure of biological macromolecules is known as molecular biology.\n\nMolecular biology was first described as an approach focused on the underpinnings of biological phenomena - uncovering the structures of biological molecules as well as their interactions, and how these interactions explain observations of classical biology.\n\nIn 1945 the term molecular biology was used by physicist William Astbury. In 1953 Francis Crick, James Watson, Rosalind Franklin, and colleagues, working at Medical Research Council unit, Cavendish laboratory, Cambridge (now the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology), made a double helix model of DNA which changed the entire research scenario. They proposed the DNA structure based on previous research done by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. This research then lead to finding DNA material in other microorganisms, plants and animals.\n\nMolecular biology is not simply the study of biological molecules and their interactions; rather, it is also a collection of techniques developed since the field's genesis which have enabled scientists to learn about molecular processes. In this way it has both complemented and improved biochemistry and genetics as methods (of understanding nature) that began before its advent. One notable technique which has revolutionized the field is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which was developed in 1983. PCR is a reaction which amplifies small quantities of DNA, and it is used in many applications across scientific disciplines.\n\nThe central dogma of molecular biology describes the process in which DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into protein.\n\nMolecular biology also plays a critical role in the understanding of structures, functions, and internal controls within individual cells, all of which can be used to efficiently target new drugs, diagnose disease, and better understand cell physiology. Some clinical research and medical therapies arising from molecular biology are covered under gene therapy whereas the use of molecular biology or molecular cell biology in medicine is now referred to as molecular medicine."}

As I peeked into the crisp new air, I saw ferns, spiders, and buzzing flies surrounding me.  But the thing that caught my attention most of all was the bright blue sky.  I wondered what was out there and if I would ever get to see it.  I had just met this world and wanted to learn so much more.  But I was only 3 inches tall and couldn't see much of anything.  So I waited.\n\nAs I got taller, the days began to feel shorter.  My favorite part of the day was feeling the wind blow through my newly acquired canopy of needles.  It wasn't much to look at, but I was proud.  I'd often stare at the giant trees around me.  How I yearned to be one of the tall redwoods.  They were kings of the forest; nothing stood taller.  I wanted to see what they could see from way up there.  One day I'll be one of them.\n\nDays turned to weeks, and weeks turned into years, and it all felt so rushed that I could hardly keep track of the changing world around me.  I had grown tall enough to see through a clearing in the upper canopy.  Beyond our patch of trees was a mountain of countless others.  Looking out into the endless distance, I began to feel small.  What a strange feeling.  One cloudy day, I saw a lightning bolt strike a hilltop.  Soon enough, bright orange flames erupted across the horizon.  What a peculiar sight.  What began as a curiosity soon became terror as the fire rushed closer to my area of the woods.  I could feel the warm wind on my face as the fire grew more prominent.  Mercifully, the dark clouds hanging overhead opened up to a torrential downpour.  Cold pelting raindrops replaced the warm breeze, night fell over the mountain, and the forest breathed a sigh of relief.  \n\nI awoke to a strange sight when the sun returned the next day.  What was once hundreds of proud redwoods was now a deep black scar on the mountain.  That would be me one day."}

{"instruction": "What is the concept of a good life according to Socrates and Aristotle, and what are the components that contribute to it? Is a good life innate or learned, and can anyone achieve it?", "input": "", "output": "One of the most tantalizing and theorized about topics is that of the meaning of life and how to live a “good” one. It is human nature to explain the unknown and create explanations for the way the world works; throughout history philosophers have come to their own conclusions on why some lives are good and others are not. Two key figures that lend insight in these respects are Socrates in Plato’s The Apology, and Aristotle in Nicomachean Ethics. A seemingly simple concept quickly devolves into a confusing and complex web of components that only together in the right proportions lend each man or woman a full good life. In order to discuss the way in which we are to lead a good life we must first discuss the differing factors that contribute to the definition of good in the eyes of Socrates and Aristotle. What are the components of the concept of good? Is it innate or learned? Can it be purchased? Is it temporary or is it eternal? Does it apply to one’s self or a community as a whole? Does one conduct oneself to be good? How Is a good life given by the gods or earned by humans? And although there is no definitive answer to any of these questions, in both author’s texts living a good life comes down to the choices you make and how they compare to the definition of good you subscribe to. Socrates and Aristotle use words such as virtue, courage, happiness, and intelligence to describe their versions of the path you take to reach a good life, and all are important, but the main driver of a good life is one’s ability to find the proper equilibrium between\nDahlke 1\n each of their characteristics that lend towards the development of a commonly defined good life.\nTheorizing on how to live a good life leads to the necessity of defining what a good life is and the components that make it up. Aristotle theorized in Nicomachean Ethics that the idea of virtue, or excellence, can be an overarching theme for the components that make up the highest “good”, the good that is an endpoint or product encompassing the entire life before it. And the development of virtue lies within a midpoint between too much and too little of any emotion, action or characteristic.\n... it is in emotions and actions that excess, deficiency and the median are found. Thus we can experience fear confidence, desire, anger, pity and generally any kind of pleasure and pain either too much or too little, and in either case not properly. But to experience all this at the right time, towards the right objects, towards the right people, for the right reason, and in the right manner — that is the median and the best course, the course that is a mark of virtue. (Aristotle. Bk. 2, pg. 43)\nAnd still, even with the most precise definition Aristotle or Socrates gives there is a great amount of ambiguity. While some characteristics or actions are classified as inherently good or bad Aristotle theorizes that simply over exercising the usage of one or two characteristics doesn’t mean you are a good person living a good life. But rather, he states that there is a median usage point between the extrema of never and always that contributes to virtue, and then a good life. Where that point is is still unknown, partly due to the infinite situational differences one person can have versus another person\nDahlke 2\n\n during their lifetime and partly due to the complexity and magnitude of the variables that contribute to the person as a whole. However, Aristotle goes into a few overarching descriptors of his definition of a virtuous man or woman to help define the median between the two extrema. For example, the median for pleasure and pain is self control, between fear and confidence is courage, and righteous falls between envy and spite.1 These examples shine a light on how to find the middle between two opposing qualities, but do not instruct on how we are to lead a good life. While definitively defining the idea of good is complex the framework of thought to use when faced with daily decisions Aristotle provides allows for the discussion on how to live a good life.\nCreating a structured plan for how to live a good life brings about the question can anyone live a good life? Furthermore, are the segments that complete virtue innate or are they learned? Aristotle delves into two schools of thought, the first being that there are some characteristics that born with can impede or halt one’s quest for moral virtue, and secondly, that one develops these traits over time and through ritual habit. The latter, he describes in analogy, “Similarly, we become just by the practice of just actions, self-controlled by exercising self-control, and courageous by performing acts of courage.” (Aristotle. Bk. 2, pg. 34) In other words, one becomes virtuous by continually being virtuous. Therefore, one finds oneself in a good life when one habitually lives within the middle of all opposing qualities. While not everyone in a society will live a good life, everyone within a society can live a good life. At this point it is important to\n1 Examples given in Book II Ch. 7 - Nicomachean Ethics\nDahlke 3\n \n refer back to the definition of what a good life is, it does not mean success, fame or wealth, but rather practicing the combination of elements that create virtue.\nWhile some qualities like virtue are relatively undisputed as good, wealth is a heavily debated part of a good life. Both Aristotle and Socrates agree that wealth is not an indicator of a good life but their thought differs when it comes to the part money plays in the development of such a life. While Aristotle believes wealth is a necessity for aspects of a virtuous life, Socrates believes that wealth is only a byproduct of a good life. Aristotle does concede to saying that, “wealth is not the good which we are trying to find, for it is only useful, i.e., it is a means to something else.” (Aristotle. Bk. 1, pg. 9) Otherwise saying that while wealth is not the end goal and is meaningless when thinking of one’s worth, it is helpful in the creation of a good life. On the other hand, Socrates writes of wealth as something that does not create excellence and at times can even inhibit it’s development. In The Apology Socrates says to the jury, “Wealth does not bring about excellence, but excellence brings about wealth and all other public and private blessings for men.” (Plato. 30b) While this quote is taken out of the context of a defensive argument, it still holds Socrates’ beliefs on wealth. He, an impoverished man, does not find the same value in money as sophists like Aristotle, and while defending his choice to not charge a fee to the pupils that followed his philosophical thought like other sophists did, he said that he is here at the service to god. Both theories on wealth’s role in a good life are important to consider. Does wealth lead to corruption and poverty to a more sinful life? Wealth, similarly to fear, needs a median. As Aristotle describes fear, too little is being reckless, while too much is being cowardly. In wealth the same thought\nDahlke 4\n\n can be applied, too little creates extreme poverty which distracts from living a virtuous life and too much can create different distractions that lead to the same result.\nAnother contesting theory is that of the length in which “goodness” lasts. When defining a good life, it is important to think about when you can use good as a descriptor. If goodness in reference to one’s life lasts forever then the term is permanent and can be applied throughout one's life. If on the contrary, goodness comes and goes throughout life the term can only be used temporarily or in posterity noting one’s life as a whole. Socrates, after the announcement of his execution states, “a good man cannot be harmed either in life or death, and that his affairs are not neglected by the gods.” (Plato. 41 c-d) Lending the idea that a good man or woman living a good life is continuous and permanent, throughout life and death. However, Aristotle argues that since a good life is a sum of smaller goods, to use the term to describe someone's life, it must come at the end of their life, looking at it as a whole. After describing smaller goals and endpoints he goes further and says, “The highest good, on the other hand, must be something final” (Aristotle. Bk. 1 pg. 14) Stating that while there are different branches of a good life, virtuous behavior is not a constant and therefore you cannot give a description to their life as a whole until it’s end. Socrates’ arguments on the length of goodness are rather naive, seeing as people change over time, only with the entire information of their lives can one make a claim as to whether or not they had a good life.\nIn summary, the two different views on how we are to live a good life together provide insight and theory into the subject but neither provides a complete instruction on doing so. Socrates, as written down by Plato, describes his own life which he\nDahlke 5\n\nconsiders to be a virtuous one and Aristotle provides a philosophical theory behind how to live in a virtuous way with the end goal of happiness or in other words a good life. The closest we can get to understanding how to live a good life is by understanding what makes up a good life, and even this is subjective. One person’s views on what a virtuous life means can differ greatly from the next depending on where they lived, their religious beliefs, or social status. These variances result in many different guides to and definitions of a good life. Within all the different viewpoints, a concept introduced in Nicomachean Ethics that can be widely accepted is that within someone’s life there is a median point between each of their emotions, actions and characteristics that create virtue and lead towards a good life."}

{"instruction": "Why is Citizen Kane considered the Best Film?", "input": "", "output": "The American Film Institute and the British Film Institute have Citizen Kane listed as the number one movie of all time.  The British Film Institute has had this rating of Citizen Kane for 50 years.  There are multitudes of reasons why this is a deserving title with a few examples below.\n\n1. Citizen Kane was a thinly veiled movie about a powerful person.  Even before the movie was released newspaper magnate William R Hearst became aware that Kane had many similarities to Hearst.  Both controlled media empires, ran for office, and had giant mansions filled with odds and ends.  Where it allegedly became personal was when scenes showing Kane's wife put through an humiliating run in showbiz propped up by Kane's largesse mirrored Hearst a bit too closely to real life.  Hearst reportedly offered to buy all copies of the film and told newspapers to not print anything or even mention its name.\n\n2. It heralded a new age of cinematography in 1941.  Citizen Kane pioneered in the mainstream many types of compositions and angles we now find quite common.  For a low angle shot in an office to show Kane's towering presence film cameras were too heavy and bulky to sit on the floor.  Cinematographer Gregg Toland solved this by having a hole dug deep enough for camera and tripod to achieve the desired effect.  Also the concept of \"deep focus\" or achieving a large depth of field to make characters near and far appear sharp is difficult to achieve.  These scenes were used to great effect to portray Kane as being surrounded and alone with his wealth later in the movie.  They also provided a literal window into a young innocent Kane during a tense scene inside the house, to which Kane was blissfully unaware but the audience experienced both to jarring effect.\n\n3. Orson Welles was famous and an excellent promoter.  Up to this point Welles most famous exploit had been his radio re-enactment of H.G. Wells \"War of the Worlds.\"  Choosing to follow a newsreel style format and not having an intro saying this is a work of fiction many listeners at home were swept up in the drama and thought an alien invasion was happening.  His popularity from this event carried a great deal of interest over to his first film.  For his first film to come together with a compelling story, technical wizardry, and cultural relevancy truly made it the standard for what a \"Best Film...\" should be.\n\nAs a sidenote in 1921 Citizen Kane won 9 Academy awards including Best Picture, Director, Editing, and Cinematography. Orson Welles would never have a similar level of success with his later films."}

From a nutrition perspective, a predominantly plant-based diet is the way to go. The Mediterranean diet continues to outperform all other diets year after year. A plant-based diet can not only prevent disease but it can reverse cardiovascular illness and many others. We now also have enough evidence on the importance of movement, exercise and specifically a combination of resistance and endurance training. Muscle growth is not only positive for the muscles themselves but it also positively affects bone density (which we tend to lose as we age), as well as effects on your immune system, gut microbiome and even mental health. The positives are endless. Lastly, if we do not get proper sleep (typically 7-9hours/night), the other two factors, diet and exercise, will not be optimal. Consistency in going to sleep and waking up at the same time is crucial to overall wellbeing and recovery. \nResearchers of the Blue Zones argue that another crucial part to living healthily into old age is the social circle or community we are part of. \nIf you want to live a long and healthy life, eat more plants, exercise, get some sleep and spend time with your friends and family."}

{"instruction": "How do you fry shrimp?", "input": "", "output": "Frying shrimp is very easy, and requires simple equipment and ingredients. \n\nUse shrimp that is U-15 or less.  Frying shrimp that are larger than U-15 will result in tough shrimp.  First, clean and devein the shrimp, and then set them aside.  \n\nThen, heat vegetable, canola or peanut oil to 375 degrees.  These oils have a high smoke point (this is the temperature at which the oil will burn and smoke), and are good choices generally for frying.   Use a cast iron pan if you have one, or another good quality pan that retains heat evenly and well.  \n\nWhile the oil is heating, prep the flour. The crispness of the shrimp will depend on the type of flour that you use.  All purpose flour is readily available, and results in a nice, crispy shrimp.  Using rice flour will result in even more crispy shrimp, although rice flour is available at Asian grocery stores and is not readily available at general grocery stores. Using corn starch will result in the crispiest shrimp.  For one pound of shrimp, use 2 cups of whatever type of flour (or cornstarch) that you would prefer, and season the flour liberally with salt and pepper, and add some red pepper flakes if you prefer a little bit of spice.  \n\nAt this point, dry the shrimp and dredge the shrimp in the flour in relatively small batches.  Set aside until the oil is ready.\n\nOnce the oil is at 375 degrees, put a few shrimp in the oil, being careful not to crowd the pan.  Too many shrimp in the oil will result in less crispy shrimp, as well as shrimp that is oily.  You should use your judgment on how many shrimp to add, depending on the size of the shrimp and the size of the pan.  The shrimp will take only a few minutes in the oil to be done, again depending on the size of the shrimp.  The shrimp will be done once it’s no longer translucent.  For shrimp that is 21/25 count or larger, using a spider (which is a type of skimmer) will make it easier to get the shrimp out of the pan.  Promptly after the shrimp is out of the pan, sprinkle salt on the shrimp and serve."}

Many residents of this sparsely populated region resent the control of these lands by distant bureaucrats whose regulations place significant restrictions on how the land is used. For this reason, movements have been ongoing for many years to work for the transfer of those lands to local authorities. While this sense of disenfranchisement is understandable, the truth is that local residents would suffer more from the loss of centralized management of these lands than they would gain through local control. This region is mostly desert, a landscape and ecosystem that is unusually vulnerable to degradation. Without the concerted efforts of an administration that can apply consistent regulation and stewardship of these lands across a broad territory that crosses state boundaries, the value of these lands to local residents would decline even further, becoming less productive and less attractive to the hunters, fishermen, and other tourists whose spending represents the majority of income for many of these Intermountain communities."}

{"instruction": "When did space exploration begin ?", "input": "", "output": "The world's first large-scale experimental rocket program was Opel-RAK under the leadership of Fritz von Opel and Max Valier during the late 1920s leading to the first crewed rocket cars and rocket planes, which paved the way for the Nazi era V2 program and US and Soviet activities from 1950 onwards. The Opel-RAK program and the spectacular public demonstrations of ground and air vehicles drew large crowds, as well as caused global public excitement as so-called \"Rocket Rumble\" and had a large long-lasting impact on later spaceflight pioneers like Wernher von Braun. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries. The early era of space exploration was driven by a \"Space Race\" between the Soviet Union and the United States. The launch of the first human-made object to orbit Earth, the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period. The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight (Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1) in 1961, the first spacewalk (by Alexei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first space station (Salyut 1) in 1971. After the first 20 years of exploration, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as the Space Shuttle program, and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nWith the substantial completion of the ISS following STS-133 in March 2011, plans for space exploration by the U.S. remain in flux. Constellation, a Bush Administration program for a return to the Moon by 2020 was judged inadequately funded and unrealistic by an expert review panel reporting in 2009. The Obama Administration proposed a revision of Constellation in 2010 to focus on the development of the capability for crewed missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO), envisioning extending the operation of the ISS beyond 2020, transferring the development of launch vehicles for human crews from NASA to the private sector, and developing technology to enable missions to beyond LEO, such as Earth–Moon L1, the Moon, Earth–Sun L2, near-Earth asteroids, and Phobos or Mars orbit."}

What\nmodifications would you make, if any?", "input": "", "output": "In practice, she may find some improvements in her hip flexibility, but certainly this is not the right, nor optimal, technique to improve her hip flexibility. She risks injuring herself with this kind of movement. This is because every tendon has a stretch reflex, and when triggered, will cause the muscle connected to it to contract; for example, when the patellar tendon underneath your knee is hit by your doctor during your yearly checkup, your quads contract involuntarily and your leg kicks up. When you are stretching, you are elongating the muscles. If you bounce while stretching, you can activate your tendon’s stretch reflex, causing your muscle to try and contract while also elongating it, which may tear the muscle or even detach the tendon from the bone in extreme cases. I would recommend her to not bounce during toe touches, and focus on keeping the motion static."}

{"instruction": "Why are drums so important to music, and what this appeal to have live drums in the modern world where drum beats can easily be sampled, and/or perfectly mimicked  by software?", "input": "", "output": "Music is often broken down into fundamental components using this model of understanding: Melody, Harmony, and Rhythm.  Of these three it is true rhythm is the easiest for computers to do a near perfect job of imitating.  Advancements in technology from the first drum machines that appeared in the 1970s, to widely used beat machines of the 1990's, to software music composition suites of today means you now have a lot of control at youf finger tips to create rhythm. You can now create drum beats that account for tempo variations, pitch variations, changes in dynamics, how close the drum pattern stays on beat, the type of hit the beat should be using, what the tension on the drum heads should sound like, how much rebound against the drum head is present, velocity of the stick, the simulated room size of where the drum kit is located,  how much resonance is vibrating in the drum kit itself, tonal variance of the wood shells used to create the drum beat and many more.   These advancements make software drumbeats realistic, and indistinguishable from their human counterparts yet the role of the drummer in modern music could not be more important.  Humans love live music, and very few commercially successful live musical acts do not use a live drummer.  Even rap and hip hop--two musical genres famous for ushering in the area of \"sampled\" drum beats, and \"sampled song loops\"-- often will have a live drummer on stage despite the ease of which the music can be broadcast loudly without requiring one.   The reason is simple: live drums and the musicians who perform using them are both visually and sonically exciting.  There are genres where a drummer is not provided such as \"DJ Couture\" and \"Electronic Dance music\" (or EDM) but they are the exceptions and not the rule. From the earliest humans banging rocks and sticks together, to the modern drums of today the future of the live drummer in music has never been brighter."}

Despite the general consensus that fossil fuels are the largest contributor to climate change, it’s also challenging to find an alternative energy source that replaces this on a global scale. As emerging nations grow, their demand for affordable energy will maintain the need for fossil fuels.  However, while  renewable energies have been projected to replace fossil fuels as the main energy source by 2050, we will still need to invest in decarbonization technology to offset the impact of maintaining emissions from fossil fuels."}

{"instruction": "What are some of the challenges and solutions involved in growing tomatoes in the Pacific Northwest?", "input": "", "output": "Growing tomatoes in the Pacific Northwest is very possible, but can present a number of challenges. The three biggest concerns revolve around:\n\n1. A short growing season\n2. Cooler summers\n3. Wetter than average summers\n\nHere are some solutions you can use to mitigate these challenges.\n\nDo deal with the short growing season, you need to get a headstart on growing by using starters. What this means is that instead of planting a seed in the ground in Springtime, you start a seed indoors in late winter, grow it into a small to medium plant, then transplant that \"starter\", into the ground when the temperature is warm enough. You can buy starters from Nurseries, or start your own at home. Nursery starters are easier, but by growing at home you can experiment with more rare varieties and gain experience in cultivating a plant from the seedling stage. If you grow your own it's important to slowly climatize the plant to outdoor weather leading up to the transplant date by moving it outside starting with a couple hours a day, increasing an hour or two per day over 2-3 weeks. By using starters you essentially extend the growing season by giving your plant a multi month head start. \n\nTomatoes mature best in warm to hot climates. The pacific northwest has cooler summers than many of the growing regions in the world. There is not a lot we can do to control mother nature, but there are one or two methods to help yourself here. Certain varieties of tomatoes do better in cooler summers - try and select these. If you're using starts from a local nursery they can guide you - starts from big national box stores might not be the best for your local Northwest climate. Another technique, if you are experiencing a cooler than normal Spring and start of Summer, is to build a \"hoop house\", using PVC pipe frame and a visqueen tarp. This will let light in and act as a mini-greenhouse, trapping heat around the plant. Keep in mind tomatoes need pollinators like bees to produce fruit, so once the plan t begins to flower you'll want to ensure pollination can occur.\n\nMoisture creates issues with Tomato plants as they are very susceptible to various types of fungus that grow on the leaves. Blight is one in particular common among tomatoes. The wet summers we sometimes have create conditions on the leaves conducive to fungal growth, they can also splash fungus onto the leaves from the soil. The easiest way to deal with these two issues is in proper pruning. As early as you can prune any lower sets of leaves that could possibly come into contact with the ground. Don't do this too soon as the plant needs some leaves to grow. There are many ways to prune a tomato that you can read about, but one common one in wet areas is called single stemming - in this technique you prune \"suckers\", which are the small offshoots that grow in between the main stem and the leaf stems. By pruning the suckers you prevent too much bushy growth, which will help the leaves dry out with airflow after a rain storm. The last issue related to water is that heavy late season rains will cause the fruits to swell with water and crack. There's not an easy solution here. If it's towards the end of the season and a rainstorm is coming in, this can be a good time to pick all your fruit, your green tomatoes can be used for green salsas. Some will resort to building a tarp structure above the plants to stop the rain, though this can require a bit more work and ingenuity, and you'll need another system to keep the plants watered.\n\nOverall, growing tomatoes in the Pacific Northwest is totally possible and very rewarding. Hopefully these tips help you to have a fruitful growing season!"}

{"instruction": "How useful is toothpaste", "input": "", "output": "Toothpaste is a paste or gel dentifrice used with a toothbrush to clean and maintain the aesthetics and health of teeth. Toothpaste is used to promote oral hygiene: it is an abrasive that aids in removing dental plaque and food from the teeth, assists in suppressing halitosis, and delivers active ingredients (most commonly fluoride) to help prevent tooth decay (dental caries) and gum disease (gingivitis). Owing to differences in composition and fluoride content, not all toothpastes are equally effective in maintaining oral health. The decline of tooth decay during the 20th century has been attributed to the introduction and regular use of fluoride-containing toothpastes worldwide. Large amounts of swallowed toothpaste can be toxic. Common colors for toothpaste include white (sometimes with colored stripes or green tint) and blue.\n\nToothpastes are generally useful to maintain dental health. Toothpastes containing fluoride are effective at preventing tooth decay. Toothpastes may also help to control and remove plaque build-up, promoting healthy gums. A 2016 systematic review indicated that using toothpaste when brushing the teeth does not necessarily impact the level of plaque removal. However, the active ingredients in toothpastes are able to prevent dental diseases with regular use."}

It’s ok to leave the sliding door unlocked during your walk. Go back in this way too. \n\nWalking - Try walking her to the Women’s garden and back. Her lease and poop bags are on the floor next to the sliding door. She doesn’t really walk fast or far anymore so if she doesn’t want to walk just take her back home. \n\nOther dogs - Chunkie doesn’t really like other dogs so keep her leash tight when other dogs are around. She does love people and is very safe w/ other people and kids.\n\nSnack - You may feed her a snack - one pig ear and a few of the other smaller snacks. I’ll leave the snacks on the kitchen counter.\n\nWater - Please refill her water bowls when you get there and make sure they are full before you leave (purple bowl in the dining room next to the window and silver bowl near sliding door).\n\nHome - Feel free to make yourself at home! Chunkie usually hangs in my office / the TV room. She does need some help getting up the 2 stairs from that room and the main great room.\n\nLocking up - Please put the lock bar back on the sliding door, leave the key on the kitchen counter (or on the bottom stairs as you exit) and lock the front door by depressing the door handle button."}

They bury themselves underground during dry periods and emerge after heavy rainfall to emit calls and breed. They feed primarily on ants and termites; predators of adults and tadpoles include snakes, dragonfly larvae, and snails. When threatened, they inflate their lungs and secrete a noxious white substance.

{"instruction": "How do I make great Neapolitan pizza dough at home?", "input": "", "output": "To make great Neapolitan pizza you need 4 ingredients. Water, yeast, flour and salt. For best results you should use typo \"00\" flour. When using such finely grained flour go for a 65% hydration dough, 3% salt, and 0.5% dry yeast. This means for every 1000 parts flour, put 650 parts water.\n\nGreat pizza dough takes time to ferment. There are few ways to do it but the easiest one for the home is to pre-ferment a small portion of equal amounts of water and flour.\n\nFor example, start with separating out the total ingredients: 1000g flour, 650g water, 30g salt, 5g dry yeast. This will result in 1680g of dough enough for ~8 medium pizzas. Mix 200g of water, flour and the yeast and let it sit on counter for an hour. Then move to the refrigerator for slow fermentation for ~24h. Take this out and add the remaining ingredients. Kneed until smooth, and let it rest on the counter for 1h. Cover with olive oil to avoid drying out. Cut balls and place in a tray. Lightly cover with olive oil again and cling film. After 1-2h the balls double in size and will be ready for some amazing pizza."}

The union did not want the slave stares to secede.

The slave states were based on a plantation system and the only fast growth was in texas. These states were largely rural with few large cities and little industry except in close proximity to free states."}

{"instruction": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of learning Java over Python?", "input": "", "output": "Java and Python are two of the most popular programming languages. Of the two, Java is the faster language, but Python is simpler and easier to learn. Each is well-established, platform-independent, and part of a large, supportive community. But that is where the similarities end. When you’re considering Python versus Java, each language has different uses for different purposes, and each has pros and cons to consider.\n\nAdvantages of Java\n\nSpeed and efficiency are two of the big draws of using Java. It's also one of the coding languages considered to be easy to learn. Because many of the processes of this high-level language run automatically, you won't have to do an intense study of how everything works as much as you would with a low-level language. You should be able to master it relatively quickly depending on how much time you can devote to learning and practicing. Other advantages of using Java include the following:\n\n(1) It's simple: The syntax is straightforward, making it easy to write. It's not as complex as languages like C++, and it uses automatic memory allocation.\n\n(2) It’s platform independent: You can use Java on multiple types of computers, including Windows, iOS, Unix, and Linux systems, as long as it has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) platform.\n\n(3) It’s object oriented: Because you create classes containing data and functions and objects that belong to those classes, it offers a more intuitive approach for big project development. It also provides flexibility and easier troubleshooting, and the ability to reuse the code.\n\n(4) It has a large global community: This is helpful when you're learning Java or should you run into any problems.\n\n(5) It supports multithreading: When you use Java, you can run more than one thread at a time. When running multiple threads, they share a common memory area to increase efficiency and performance.\n\n(6) It’s secure: Java avoids using explicit pointers, runs inside a virtual machine called a sandbox, uses byte-code verifier to check for illegal code, and provides library-level safety along with Java security package and run-time security checks. \n\nDisadvantages of Java\n\nBefore deciding whether Java is the right programming language for you to start with, it’s essential to consider its weaknesses. One of the main downsides to using Java is that it uses a large amount of memory—considerably more than Python.\n\nAdditionally, Java manages its memory through garbage collection, which happens once the application you’re working on no longer references the object. Java’s garbage collector clears it from memory, but during the process, other threads have to stop while the garbage collector works. The step impacts the overall performance of the application. Other disadvantages include:\n\n(1) It doesn’t offer control over garbage collection: As a programmer, you won’t have the ability to control garbage collection using functions like free() or delete().\n\n(2) It has a lot of words: Although Java is simple, it does tend to have a lot of words in it, which will often leave you with complex, lengthy sentences and explanations.\n\n(3) It doesn't have a native look when you use it for desktops: Java has multiple graphical user interface (GUI) builders, but they aren't the best if you're creating complex UI on a desktop. Java is weaker when you're using it for desktop versus mobile when it comes to user experience and user interface. While there are many GUI builders to choose from, you'll need to do a lot of research to find the right one for your project.\n\n\nPython: The simple path\n\nAlthough Java is faster, Python is more versatile, easier to read, and has a simpler syntax. According to Stack Overflow, this general use, interpreted language is the fourth most popular coding language.  It's also one of the most in-demand programming languages that hiring managers look for when hiring candidates, according to HackerRank, second only to JavaScript. \n\nPython's popularity has experienced explosive growth in the past few years, with more than 11.3 million coders choosing to use it, mainly for IoT, data science, and machine learning applications, according to ZDNet. Further, Python has had a 25 percent growth rate, adding 2.3 million developers to its community between Q3 2020 and Q3 2021, according to SlashData's “State of the Developer Nation.”.\n\nAdvantages of Python\n\nPython’s versatility is difficult to match, and it's so flexible that it encourages experimentation. This keeps programmers from being pigeonholed into only building one type of application. You can learn just one language and use it to make new and different things.\n\nComputer Weekly calls Python the most versatile programming language, noting that “Although there might be a better solution for any given problem, Python will always get the job done well”. Other advantages of Python include:\n\n(1) It’s platform-independent: Like Java, you can use Python on various platforms, including macOS, Windows, and Linux. You’ll just need an interpreter designed for that platform.\n\n(2) It allows for fast development: Because Python is dynamically typed, it's fast and friendly for development. Additionally, it uses asynchronous code to tackle situations and challenges faster because each unit of code runs separately.\n\n(3) It offers extensive libraries: Its large library supports common tasks and commands. It also contains code that can be used for many different purposes, ranging from generating documentation to unit testing to CGI.\n\n(4) It offers a more flexible approach to programming: Python supports a variety of programming styles and has multiple paradigms. Not only is this optimal for programmers who enjoy flexibility, but it also makes it ideal for start-ups that might need to shift approaches abruptly.\n\n(5) It's free and open-source: You can download Python without any cost, and because it's so easy to learn and boasts one of the largest and most active communities—you should be able to start writing code in mere minutes.\n\n(6) It may boost productivity: NetGuru says that Python is more productive than Java because of how concise it is and because it's dynamically typed. Additionally, it has control capabilities and integration features that can make applications more productive.\n\nDisadvantages of Python\n\nWhile Python is arguably one of the easiest and fastest languages to learn, it’s also decidedly slower to execute because it’s a dynamically typed, interpreted language, executed line-by-line. Python does extra work while executing the code, making it less suitable for use in projects that depend on speed. However, if speed isn’t a sensitive issue, Python’s slower nature won’t likely be a problem.\n\nOther potential disadvantages include:\n\n(1) It only executes one thread at a time: Python has a Global Interpreter Lock that only lets one thread execute at a time, so if you're working on a multi-threaded CPU-bound program, it'll likely be even slower. Using multiprocessing programs instead of multithreaded programs can be an effective workaround.\n\n(2) It isn't mobile native: Python can be effectively and easily used for mobile purposes, but you'll need to put a bit more effort into finding libraries that give you the necessary framework. Some examples include Kivy, which lets you use the same API to create mobile apps and software that you can run on Raspberry PI, Linux, and Windows.\n\n(3) It uses a large amount of memory: If you're working on a project where many objects are active in RAM, this could present an issue for you. Switching to NumPy could be an effective workaround to reduce the amount of memory Python uses for each object."}

Instead, it's normal for me to watch the radar when a storm system is moving through to see where the tornados are and how close they are to me. \n\nOnce, the radar showed a tornado southwest of our house - moving towards us. When it was within a couple miles of us, my wife took the dogs and blankets and went to our safe place - an internal bathroom. I stood back from the windows and watched the tv. From my position, I could see out the back windows which faced west - southwest. The weather showed that the tornado was right on top of us. I watched out the window as a fragment of a four by four, about a foot and a half long, flipped up from the ground and tumbled across the lawn. \n\nIt was that moment that I decided I had watched enough and stepped into the bathroom to join my wife and the dogs. The storm blew over us. The tornado wasn't on the ground as it passed by, but it was definitely and intense several minutes as we waited. \n\nI have seen my fair share of storms and had a number of close calls with tornados. This definitely falls in one of my top 5."}
{"instruction": "What is John Ellis water and the bond angle of water?", "input": "", "output": "Traditional tap and purified water has a hydrogen bond angle of 104 - 104.5 degrees.  John Ellis water takes standard tap or purified water and changes the hydrogen bond angle of it from 104 degrees to 113 - 114 degrees.  Changing the bond angle is done using multi-pass distillation by rapidly heating and cooling the water inside the boiling chamber.\n\nWater consumed with a bond angle above 108° degrees eliminates the effect of potential pathogens in our food supply (e.g. bacterium, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) from affecting our bodies because more oxygen from the water mixes with the superior blood flow to all the extremities of our body.  The larger bond angle enables our bodies to use more of the oxygen present in the water."}

According to historian P. Thankappan Nair, dosa originated in the town of Udupi in present-day Karnataka. However, according to food historian K. T. Achaya, references in the Sangam literature suggest that dosa was already in use in the ancient Tamil country around the 1st century CE. Achaya states that the earliest written mention of dosa appears in literature of present-day Tamil Nadu, in the 8th century, while the earliest mention of dosa in the Kannada literature appears a century later.\n\nIn popular tradition, the origin of the dosa is linked to Udupi, probably because of the dish's association with Udupi restaurants. The Tamil dosai is softer and thicker. The thinner and crispier version of dosa was first made in present-day Karnataka. A recipe for dosa can be found in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.\n\nAfter the Independence of India, South Indian cuisine became gradually popular in the North. In Delhi, the Madras Hotel in Connaught Place became one of the first restaurants to serve South Indian cuisine. It arrived in Mumbai with the Udupi restaurants in the 1930s."}

{"instruction": "Write an essay about whether corona policy measures are beneficial towards society or not", "input": "", "output": "After nearly two years of the COVID-19 pandemic and yet another lockdown, many people around the Netherlands are growing restless and fed up with the restrictions. According to the Rijksoverheid, a record-breaking 74,000 cases were confirmed in the Netherlands on January 28th, with just ten corona-related ICU admissions or deaths (“Infections- Confirmed Cases”, 2022). This raises the debate: should the government continue enforcing these measures or not? In order to formulate an answer, one must first understand the virus and how it spreads, and then consider the debate from political, ethical, social and economic perspectives.\nThe first reported case of SARS-CoV-2, which causes the COVID-19 disease, was on December 31, 2019 (\"Coronavirus disease\", 2022), and it set off a chain reaction of political instability worldwide. What first started as an epidemic within China had reached almost every country in the world within months. In the last 20 years, many countries have been affected by viruses related to Covid-19 such as SARS. Because of previous experience, they took appropriate measures immediately. For example, China has had no more than 110,000 cases since the start of the pandemic, even though it has almost a population of 1.5 billion (Worldometer, 2022). However, a less politically stable country, such as Turkey, was less prepared and suffered from 12 million cases, even though it has a population of 85 million. The virus spreads very quickly because of its airborne transmission mechanism. If one is near an infected person, the carrier’s exhalation may carry the virus and can be inhaled by healthy individuals. Putting on a mask and keeping distance help prevent infected individuals from spreading virus particles into the vicinity of healthy people. However, in countries where measures were not enforced, there was a large increase in excessive deaths. The new omicron variant is proving to spread at least 20 times faster than the original strain because of its 30 mutations (Grossman and Stahel, 2022). Fortunately, it is also far less deadly because it does not attack lung tissue in its earlier stages (Zimmer and Ghorayshi, 2021).\nOne can also analyze coronavirus restrictions from an ethical perspective: should we  lower corona measures even though doing so may put more lives at risk? As of January 28th 2021, the coronavirus has a death rate of 0.51%. This is relatively high compared to other respiratory viruses such as influenza, which has a mortality rate of 0.01%. COVID-19 disproportionally affects vulnerable groups, such as those with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, obesity, or autoimmune diseases. This is especially true in the elderly, because of the increased amount of health conditions as well as an immune system deteriorated by age. The coronavirus infects the upper respiratory tract, including the lungs. It breaks into cells and orders them to create copies of the virus. The cell then bursts open and sends new copies of the virus toward other cells. Eventually, if there is not an effective immune response, the patient will perish due to lung damage, especially with the strains of COVID-19 prior to the Omicron variant. During a lockdown, there is minimal human contact, which slows down the spread of the virus. However, preventing social contact has its own devastating effects. For example, during the lockdown there were over 2.5 million children at risk of falling behind on learning (“Jongeren” 2021') (\"Education and COVID-19\", 2022). Furthermore, according to OSF Healthcare, “Average weekly visits to the emergency department for suspected suicide attempts among young girls were up more than 50% from the same period a year ago” (OSF Health Care, 2021). Thus, even though more lives are put at stake, by taking extra measures for those in the risk group, one can safely reopen society and prevent suicides and learning disbilities in the youth. Moreover, vaccines can prevent major damage to tissues from happening in the first place.\nFrom a societal perspective, coronavirus has proven to be a “splinter issue”, pushing some people into vaccine denial. Many citizens are refraining from getting vaccines without truly understanding the consequences. There are two types of vaccines: mRNA and viral vector. The mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was the first mRNA vaccine to be used in the general public. mRNA vaccines have RNA inside lipids which help the RNA enter the cell. Ribosomes read the RNA and instruct the cells to make the same spike proteins as SARS-CoV-2. The body then recognizes that the Corona spike proteins are invaders and creates antibodies to destroy them. In comparison, viral vector vaccines insert a harmless copy of the virus with the same spike protein DNA, causing the immune system to attack it and remember it. For both types of vaccines, memory B cells will continue to create antibodies in case the person gets exposed to the real virus in the future. According to Dr. Stahel, “Omicron has mutated so much that it has less affinity in terms of the antibodies from the vaccine recognizing it, so, therefore, the answer is the booster shot, because you will overwhelm the virus with the quantity of the immune response even if there is not a perfect match” (Grossman and Stahel, 2022). Thus, the original vaccine doses and, more recently, the booster shot play an important role in preventing infections, but more importantly in reducing the chance of severe illness and death. However, new studies have shown that effective immunity can wear off within six months, making it necessary to get annual doses, similar to influenza (Doucleff). 13.6% of the population over 18 refuses to get vaccinated, primarily because of distrust in the government (“Vaccinations COVID-19 vaccinations”, 2022). This limits the effects of herd immunity, a concept in which if enough people are vaccinated the virus will no longer be able to spread due to all the targets being immune.\nFinally, one must consider the economic implications of a lockdown. The lockdown caused colossal unemployment, particularly for those who worked in the travel industry. For example, according to the world economic forum, 114 million people lost their jobs during 2020 (Richter, 2021). Furthermore, the lockdowns across the world also caused an estimated 3.2 trillion euro loss in labor income. Even with the devastating economic effects, one must consider the fact that lives are put at stake when appropriate corona measures are not taken. According to NPR, there would have been approximately 488 times the number of cases in China if insufficient measures were taken, hence saving millions of lives (Beaubien, 2020). \n\tIn conclusion, by considering COVID-19 from a political, ethical, social and economic lens, I conclude that even though the virus is highly contagious and fatal towards certain groups, lockdowns are only temporary solutions. A lockdown is only beneficial to our society once excessive mortality starts rising. Hence, by taking measures early on, countries can limit the spread of the virus. For example, it took six months before mask-wearing was seen as a viable measure. As seen in the first lockdown, tens of thousands of people lost their jobs and over 2.5 million children had to do remote learning in the Netherlands (\"Jongeren\", 2021). Thus, by taking measures on time and being prepared, one need not go into lockdown. However, if the deaths start to become excessive, it is worth enforcing a proportional amount of corona measures."}

{"instruction": "What planning should you do to visit Walt Disney World?", "input": "", "output": "You should start planning your Walt Disney World vacation at least six months in advance.  First figure out your travel arrangements.  If you are able to drive, you will have your own vehicle available to travel to the parks.  If you fly, you will either need a rental car or will need to use other forms of transportation, such as uber or lyft.  Within the Walt Disney World parks and resorts there is Disney provided transportation, but it is often crowded during peak hours such as park opening and closing.  Next you will need to decide where to stay.  The Walt Disney World resorts are the most convenient, but also the most expensive option.  There are Walt Disney World resorts cater to different economic levels from more affordable up to more luxurious.  Staying on the grounds will also often allow to enter parks earlier or stay later than the general public.  Staying off the grounds is usually less expensive.  There are many hotels and resorts in the Orlando area to choose from.  Other options are to use a rental service such as VRBO or AirBnB to rent a property such as a house or condo for your stay.  Next you need to decide on how many days in the parks you'll spend and whether you will stay in one park for an entire day or want to have the option to \"park hop\".  Tickets are discounted for a larger number of days in the park.  The \"park hopper\" option is a premium on top of the base ticket price.  Often there are discount ticket websites but be careful about scams.  The safest is to buy from Disney or a licensed travel advisor.  Typically the price from a travel advisor is they same as buying from Disney.  Next make a budget for how much you'll spend on food in the parks.  Food is fairly pricy, but there are options from counter service all the way up to sit down restaurants and fine dining.  Realize that eating in a sit down restaurant will take time away from other activities in the parks.  Reservations can be made on the Disney website but are often difficult to get for some restaurants.  Taking food into the park is also an option as there are lockers available at the parks to store things.  Some items such as knives are not allowed, so plan ahead if food needs to be sliced.  Next look at the rides and attractions that your family wants to ride and make a plan for which are the most important.  A guidebook such as the Unauthorized Guide to Disney World is very helpful to provide plans for your day(s) in the parks.  These guidebooks will give you help on when the lines for attractions will be shorter.  Don't just try to show up in a park without some sort of plan as to which attractions to visit and when.  Visiting without a plan will result in frustration, long waits, and disappointment.  Also realize that you will not be able to visit all of the park attractions in one visit.  As the time of your visit approaches watch the weather reports.  Late afternoon thunderstorms are typical in Orlando in the summertime.  Most attractions at Disney World are indoors and will continue operating during rain.  Rain ponchos can be purchased in the park, but they are more expensive in park than if you bring your own.  It can also be very hot during the summer, so plan on having water, sunscreen and wearing appropriate clothing for the weather.  Be aware of how your party's attitude is during your visit.  Visiting Disney World requires a lot of walking and also requires stamina.  If people are getting tired, take a break, either in the park or back at your hotel.  Don't make your visit a \"death march\".  Also base the length of your stay in the park on the age of people in your party.  Young children or elderly may require longer and more frequent breaks.  One option is to go to the park in the morning, go back to your hotel in the afternoon for a dip in the pool, and return to the park later afternoon or evening.  Pay attention to the park hours to know how early you can arrive and how late you can stay.  Most parks have some sort of parade and fireworks show at closing.  Most are very worthwhile to see.  And remember above all that you should have fun.  Don't be so focused on your plan of visiting attractions that you don't take advantage of spur of the moment opportunities such as interacting with characters or getting a quick photo with the family.  Hopefully this will not be your only vacation at Disney World, and you want to have fond memories of your visit so that you will want to return again as soon as possible."}

{"instruction": "Is the lacavore diet beneficial?", "input": "", "output": "While it is harmful to the world trade and transportation of foods, the locavore diet is generally beneficial to the environment, local farmers, and people. In a small community, the locavore diet would contribute to the local economy as well as the health of the population.\n\tThe locavore diet is a restriction in which people are encouraged to eat foods produced within a 100 mile radius of them, which not only benefits their health, as they are eating organic, locally produced foods, but also local farmers, by buying their produce, and the environment, by eliminating the harmful effects of transportation, such as airplanes and trucks.\nA common concern of younger generations is the state of our environment, thanks to the continuation of air and water pollution as well as global warming. The locavore diet targets these exact concerns. In Source A, Maiser notes that a study from the journal Food Policy in 2005 found that buying locally produced foods eliminated the environmental damage that most food transportation causes. The locavore diet is not only friendly to the environment but also to the farmers who produce organic foods. In the USA, the increased purchasing of local foods has created a revival of small farms, with the number of small farms rising 20%, or approximately 1.2 million farms, in just the past six years (Source E). In small communities where small farms are a main source of produce, the locavore diet benefits the local economy, as more money is spent on local farmers and businesses. The increase in small farms within America is also beneficial to the national economy, as money is being spent within the country and perpetuates within our economy.\nDespite its benefits to local farmers, farmers from around the world who were dependent upon the trade and transportation of foods have been suffering. For example, Kenya is responsible for most of the UK’s green beans, and while the locavore diet would support local farmers in the UK, approximately 1.5 million of Kenyan farmers’ livelihoods would be threatened. However, the same argument could be applied to local farmers: the import of foods from countries like Kenya decreases the money spent on small, local farms. In addition, eliminating the need to import food is beneficial to the national economy, as money is being spent on American farmers, who will then spend that money in America, rather than being spent outside of the country.\nPerhaps the most powerful appeal to the locavore diet is its healthiness. Not only do local foods have fewer susceptibility to contamination, but the physical distance of local foods causes them to harbor more powerful vitamins, minerals, and disease-fighting substances. In Source B, Smith argues that because local fruits and vegetables travel shorter distances, they are therefore more likely to be closer to maximum nutritional value. In a notoriously unhealthy society, Americans are likely to benefit from the locavore diet because it emphasizes the importance of eating fruits and vegetables.\nThe locavore diet, while having some drawbacks, is overall beneficial to small communities: it keeps local farms in business which in turn stimulates the local and national economies, it reduces potentially harmful environmental impacts by decreasing the use of air and road transportation, and it allows for more nutritional value in the foods people eat. Worldwide, the locavore diet may not be as helpful, as it would all but eliminate the need for food trade. However, for small, tight-knit communities, the locavore diet would be arguably beneficial."}

The memories, conversations, scents, roasted marshmallows, and crackling of the wood are all part of the experience.   In order to build a strong campfire, you need to perform the following steps.\nStep 1.  Clear a perimeter that is roughly 12 feet in diameter.   Make sure you are in an open area, where tree limbs are not hanging over the campfire to avoid secondary fires.   Before you start the fire, get all of the necessary components such as dry kindle/twigs, larger sticks, and larger logs, paper, and lighter\nStep 2.   Build a small tepee shape with the dry kindle and dry small logs.    I would recommend adding paper with the kindle to assist in starting the fire.\nStep 3.  Stack larger sticks around the teepee structure in a square formation.   Build up multiple levels, so the square structue is higher than the teepee.   This will help the fire expand and spread to the surrounding structure.\nStep 4.  Light the paper in the teepee with a match or lighter, and watch the  dry kindle  start to catch.    At this early stage, you will most likely see smoke.   You may need to blow on the teepee structure lightly in order to add some oxygen to the fire and help it catch to the larger sticks square structure.\nStep 5.  Once the square structure begins to light, start to add larger logs diagonally across the structure.   The diagonal formation will fuel the fire, and expand upwards .\nStep 6.  Keep adding larger logs to maintain the fire.   With the prior kindle, sticks, and logs already hot, adding the new larger logs will burn quickly and self ignite.\nStep 7.   When you are done enjoying the fire, have a couple of buckets of water nearby to extinguish it.   Do not leave the campfire unattended as the hot coals and wind could cause a unintended spread."}

Table salt is most commonly applied “at the table” when eating, however many home cooks don’t tend to keep multiple types of salt on hand so they might season their food with table salt during the cooking process.  \nKosher salt is a more flaky salt and typically used either in larger quantities for brining or creating a salt crust on proteins prior to cooking.  Most professional chefs will choose Kosher salt over table salt as they prefer the texture and usability.  Table salt, being very fine-grained, is more dense than kosher salt and as such, recipes using salt should be weighed rather than using a volume measurement to ensure that a different type of salt doesn’t ruin the recipe."}

In this way, overall social utility is maximized in the sense that the optimal level of voter happiness will be achieved. Ranked voting will give centrist and more moderate candidates and parties a greater chance to succeed in elections, reducing the power of the extreme elements on both sides of the political spectrum. It will encourage more moderate candidates to step forward and more moderate third parties to form. The extreme partisanship currently existing in politics will be mitigated. Donald Trump would likely not have won the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 because, although he had a very committed backing of a large minority of Republican voters, he faced a divided field of more moderate and traditional candidates who split the more rational majority of the party. Trump would likely not have been the second choice for many of the backers of other candidates. A more moderate candidate would likely have emerged as the eventual nominee. Opponents of ranked voting cite possible complexity and greater threat of computerized hacking or errors impacting election results. Entrenched politicians of both major parties oppose ranked voting because they do not want to encourage the formation of centrist third parties that could jeopardize the standing of their parties and their own political careers."}

{"instruction": "What is Assembler?", "input": "", "output": "An assembler program creates object code by translating combinations of mnemonics and syntax for operations and addressing modes into their numerical equivalents. This representation typically includes an operation code (\"opcode\") as well as other control bits and data. The assembler also calculates constant expressions and resolves symbolic names for memory locations and other entities. The use of symbolic references is a key feature of assemblers, saving tedious calculations and manual address updates after program modifications. Most assemblers also include macro facilities for performing textual substitution – e.g., to generate common short sequences of instructions as inline, instead of called subroutines.\n\nSome assemblers may also be able to perform some simple types of instruction set-specific optimizations. One concrete example of this may be the ubiquitous x86 assemblers from various vendors. Called jump-sizing, most of them are able to perform jump-instruction replacements (long jumps replaced by short or relative jumps) in any number of passes, on request. Others may even do simple rearrangement or insertion of instructions, such as some assemblers for RISC architectures that can help optimize a sensible instruction scheduling to exploit the CPU pipeline as efficiently as possible."}

He was excited about his new job but also overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information he needed to absorb. Fortunately, he was assigned a mentor - Chad - who promised to teach him everything he knew.\nChad patiently guided Tim through the ins and outs of the job, sharing his knowledge and experience to help Tim become more confident in his abilities. Tim was a quick learner and soon became very good at his job. As he gained more experience, Chad slowly stepped away, allowing Tim to take on more responsibility on his own.\nDespite this increased independence, Tim still reached out to Chad when he needed help or advice. Chad continued to guide him, but only as needed, letting Tim take the lead in his own professional development.\nAs Tim was promoted to a new role, he was assigned a new mentor - Rob - who followed the same approach as Chad. Tim threw himself into the new position, soaking up everything he could learn from Rob. Another five years passed by and he became very good at his job.\nHowever, after a decade of experience, Tim found himself at a crossroads, uncertain about what to do next. Over lunch one day, he confided in Jared, a manager from another team, about his indecisiveness. Jared listened attentively and asked Tim some probing questions to help him think through his options.\nTo each of Tim's responses, Jared asked more questions, guiding him towards a clearer understanding of his own goals and desires. Tim began meeting with Jared every week for lunch, answering the questions posed to him, and finding his own answers with Jared's help. This is what a coach does - helping individuals discover their own solutions by posing the right questions.\nIn conclusion, a mentor teaches and guides someone towards expertise, while a coach helps individuals discover their own solutions and goals by asking the right questions. While the two roles may overlap in some ways, they each offer unique benefits and serve distinct purposes in helping individuals reach their full potential."}

First played in 1903, the World Series championship is a best-of-seven playoff and is a contest between the champions of baseball's National League (NL) and American League (AL). Often referred to as the \"Fall Classic\", the modern World Series has been played every year since 1903 with two exceptions: in 1904, when the NL champion New York Giants declined to play the AL champion Boston Americans; and in 1994, when the series was canceled due to the players' strike.\n\nThe best-of-seven style has been the format of all World Series except in 1903, 1919, 1920, and 1921, when the winner was determined through a best-of-nine playoff. Although the large majority of contests have been played entirely during the month of October, a small number of Series have also had games played during September and November. The Series-winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy.

It was conceived by Walt Disney in the 1960s and was known as the \"The Florida Project\".  Walt Disney originally envisioned including a planned community known as the \"Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow\" (EPCOT) which would be a planned community that would test city-living innovations.  As planning progressed, plans for EPCOT evolved to become just a theme park in the complex.  Walt Disney died in 1966 during planning and the company was torn whether to move forward with the project.  Walt Disney's brother, Roy Disney, came out of retirement to see the project successfully completed.  There are four theme parks in the complex.  The Magic Kingdom opened in 1971, followed by Epcot in 1982, Disney's Hollywood Studios in 1989, and Disney's Animal Kingdom in 1998.  Roy Disney insisted the name be changed to Walt Disney World from the original name of just Disney World to remind people that it was Walt's dream."}

{"instruction": "Why is a refrigerator door more difficult to open than usual soon after you have closed it?", "input": "", "output": "This can be explained by the difference in pressure between the outside and inside of the refrigerator. In order to understand the phenomenon, let's first break down the relationship between pressure and temperature. Warmer air has a higher pressure than cooler air, it has to do with the energy of air molecules but that is a subject for another time. When you open the refrigerator door, warmer air from the surroundings, which would be at room temperature, rushes inside the refrigerator. This is because the air flows from the higher-pressure region (the room), into the lower-pressure region (inside the refrigerator). When you shut the door, the warm air that had moved inside is now actively being cooled down by the refrigerator. Remember what we said about cooler air? The pressure inside the refrigerator starts to drop. This means that warmer air at higher pressure outside the refrigerator is trying to get in and is pushing against the door, the next time you try to open the door, you need to apply an extra force to counteract that pressure that is acting on the door. So that begs the question, why is this more noticeable a short time after you shut the door versus coming back let's say, an hour later? Glad you asked! It is because the seal that keeps the warm air outside and cool air inside the refrigerator is not a perfect seal, it is not designed to be for good reason. Over time, since the seal allows the movement of air, the pressure equalizes. In the absence of that pressure differential, there is no force acting on the outside of the door forcing it shut. Fun fact, commercial refrigerators have seals designed to allow for a lot more movement of air compared to home refrigerators. Want to guess why? It is because content inside commercial refrigerators needs to be accessed a lot more frequently. If their seals were similar to home refrigerators, people would experience the extra force each time they want to get something! It is fascinating how much thought goes into designing everyday things we take for granted!"}
{"instruction": "Who are Torvill and Dean?", "input": "", "output": "Torvill and Dean (Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean) are English ice dancers and former British, European, Olympic, and World champions. At the Sarajevo 1984 Winter Olympics the pair won gold and became the highest-scoring figure skaters of all time for a single programme, receiving twelve perfect 6.0s and four 5.9s which included artistic impression scores of 6.0 from every judge, after skating to Maurice Ravel's Boléro. One of the most-watched television events ever in the United Kingdom, their 1984 Olympics performance was watched by a British television audience of more than 24 million people.The couple went on to record an even higher score at the 1984 World Championships, thirteen 6.0s and five 5.9s.\n\nThe pair turned professional following the 1984 World Championships, regaining amateur status briefly ten years later in 1994 to compete in the Olympics once again. The pair retired from competitive skating for good in 1998 when they toured one last time with their own show, Ice Adventures, before rejoining Stars on Ice for one more season. Their final routine was performed to Paul Simon's \"Still Crazy After All These Years\", a routine they had devised a few years earlier for competition. Although remaining close friends, the pair did not skate together again until they were enticed out of retirement to take part in ITV's Dancing on Ice. Their career was portrayed in the 2018 biographical film Torvill & Dean.\n\nBoth are from Nottingham, England, where the local National Ice Centre is accessed through a public area known as Bolero Square, in honour of the pair's Olympic achievements. There is also a housing estate in the Wollaton area of the city with a street named 'Torvill Drive' and another named 'Dean Close' which is located just off Torvill Drive, with many of the surrounding roads named after coaches and dances associated with the pair. In a UK poll conducted by Channel 4 in 2002, the British public voted Torvill and Dean's winning performance at the 1984 Winter Olympics as Number 8 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments."}

Senators and representatives are chosen through direct election, though vacancies in the Senate may be filled by a governor's appointment. Congress has 535 voting members: 100 senators and 435 representatives. The U.S. vice president has a vote in the Senate only when senators are evenly divided. The House of Representatives has six non-voting members.\n\nThe sitting of a Congress is for a two-year term, at present, beginning every other January. Elections are held every even-numbered year on Election Day. The members of the House of Representatives are elected for the two-year term of a Congress. The Reapportionment Act of 1929 established that there be 435 representatives, and the Uniform Congressional Redistricting Act requires that they be elected from single-member constituencies or districts. It is also required that the congressional districts be apportioned among states by population every ten years using the U.S. census results, provided that each state has at least one congressional representative. Each senator is elected at-large in their state for a six-year term, with terms staggered, so every two years approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election. Each state, regardless of population or size, has two senators, so currently, there are 100 senators for the 50 states."}

{"instruction": "What should I not do if I see a bear?", "input": "", "output": "Everyone knows that bears are not fluffy friends, and are unfortunately likely to maul humans. There is clear guidance on what to do depending on what type of bear you see: if it’s a black bear, make yourself loud and fight if necessary. If it’s a brown bear, lay down and cover your head. If it’s a polar bear, hope you updated your will recently. However, there is very little guidance on what not to do if you see a bear. Thankfully it is easy to provide guidance that applies to all bear types. First, do not attempt to hug the bear. While they do look fluffy and very much in need of a hug, bears highly value consent and will attempt to eat you if you ignore that. Next, do not invite a bear over for dinner. While some bears, black bears especially, may look like good dinner guests they are known for extremely rude eating habits and will likely dirty your house. Further, some types of bears might think that you are the menu. It is also not a good idea to challenge a bear to a game of basketball. Most bears are actually extremely adept at basketball, and this would likely hurt your ego considerably as they would dunk on you and then eat you as a celebration for winning. While this is not an exhaustive list of what not to do if you see a bear, it covers the most common questions."}

{"instruction": "Is it better to buy a used car compared to a new car?", "input": "", "output": "When it comes to buying a car, there are two main options: buying a new car or buying a used car. While both options have their advantages and disadvantages, many people wonder if it is better to buy a used car compared to a new car. In this article, we will explore the pros and cons of buying a used car and help you decide if it is the right choice for you.\n\nPros of Buying a Used Car\n\n1. Lower Price\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of buying a used car is the lower price. Used cars are typically much cheaper than new cars, even if they are only a few years old. This is because new cars lose value quickly as soon as they are driven off the dealership lot. By buying a used car, you can often get a great deal and save thousands of dollars.\n\n2. Lower Depreciation\n\nNew cars depreciate quickly in the first few years of ownership, often losing up to 50% of their value. Used cars, on the other hand, have already gone through this initial depreciation period, so they lose value at a much slower rate. This means that if you decide to sell your used car in a few years, you may not lose as much money as you would with a new car.\n\n3. Lower Insurance Costs\n\nInsurance costs for a used car are typically lower than for a new car. This is because used cars are less expensive, so the insurance company does not have to pay out as much if the car is damaged or totaled. Additionally, if you own the car outright, you may be able to choose a lower level of insurance coverage, which can further reduce your insurance costs.\n\n4. More Options\n\nWhen you buy a used car, you have a wider range of options to choose from than if you were buying a new car. You can choose from different makes, models, and years, and you may be able to find a car with features that are no longer available on new cars. This means that you can find a car that fits your specific needs and preferences.\n\n5. No Hidden Fees\n\nWhen you buy a new car, you may be charged various fees and expenses, such as a destination fee, dealer preparation fee, and advertising fee. With a used car, you do not have to worry about these hidden fees, as they have already been paid by the previous owner.\n\nCons of Buying a Used Car\n\n1. Higher Maintenance Costs\n\nUsed cars may require more maintenance and repairs than new cars, especially if they are older or have high mileage. This can result in higher maintenance costs, which can offset some of the savings you get from buying a used car.\n\n2. Higher Interest Rates\n\nIf you are financing a used car, you may have to pay a higher interest rate than if you were financing a new car. This is because lenders consider used cars to be a greater risk, as they are more likely to need repairs and maintenance.\n\n3. Limited Warranty\n\nMany used cars do not come with a warranty, or the warranty may have expired. This means that if something goes wrong with the car, you will have to pay for the repairs out of pocket. Some dealerships offer extended warranties for used cars, but these can be expensive.\n\n4. Unknown History\n\nWhen you buy a used car, you may not know the full history of the vehicle. The previous owner may not have disclosed all accidents or repairs, and there may be hidden issues that only become apparent after you have purchased the car.\n\n5. Less Advanced Features\n\nUsed cars may not have the latest technology and safety features that are available on new cars. This can be a disadvantage if you are looking for a car with advanced features, such as a backup camera or lane departure warning.\n\nConclusion\n\nBuying a used car can be a great option for many people, as it offers a lower price, slower depreciation, lower insurance costs, more options, and no hidden fees. However, there are also some disadvantages to buying a used car, such as higher maintenance costs, limited warranty, unknown history, higher interest rates, and less advanced features. Ultimately, the decision to buy a used car or a new car depends on your personal preferences and budget."}

{"instruction": "Who is Barack Obama?", "input": "", "output": "Barack Hussein Obama II (/bəˈrɑːk huːˈseɪn oʊˈbɑːmə/ (listen) bə-RAHK hoo-SAYN oh-BAH-mə; born August 4, 1961) is an American former politician who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African-American president of the United States. Obama previously served as a U.S. senator representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and as an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004, and worked as a civil rights lawyer before holding public office.\n\nObama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, he enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Turning to elective politics, he represented the 13th district in the Illinois Senate from 1997 until 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate primary win, his well-received keynote address at the July Democratic National Convention, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president and chose Joe Biden as his running mate. Obama was elected over Republican nominee John McCain in the presidential election and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, a decision that drew a mixture of praise and criticism.\n\nObama's first-term actions addressed the global financial crisis and included a major stimulus package, a partial extension of George W. Bush's tax cuts, legislation to reform health care, a major financial regulation reform bill, and the end of a major US military presence in Iraq. Obama also appointed Supreme Court justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, the former being the first Hispanic American on the Supreme Court. He ordered the counterterrorism raid which killed Osama bin Laden and downplayed Bush's counterinsurgency model, expanding air strikes and making extensive use of special forces while encouraging greater reliance on host-government militaries.\n\nAfter winning re-election by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for a second term on January 20, 2013. In his second term, Obama took steps to combat climate change, signing a major international climate agreement and an executive order to limit carbon emissions. Obama also presided over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and other legislation passed in his first term, and he negotiated a nuclear agreement with Iran and normalized relations with Cuba. The number of American soldiers in Afghanistan fell dramatically during Obama's second term, though U.S. soldiers remained in Afghanistan throughout Obama's presidency.\n\nDuring Obama's terms as president, the United States' reputation abroad and the American economy improved significantly, although the country experienced high levels of partisan divide. Obama left office on January 20, 2017, and continues to reside in Washington, D.C. His presidential library in Chicago began construction in 2021. Since leaving office, Obama has remained active in Democratic politics, including campaigning for candidates in various American elections. Outside of politics, Obama has published three bestselling books: Dreams from My Father (1995), The Audacity of Hope (2006) and A Promised Land (2020). Rankings by scholars and historians, in which he has been featured since 2010, place him in the middle to upper tier of American presidents."}

{"instruction": "What is the analysis of mutations in cancer, in genomics?", "input": "", "output": "In cancer, the genomes of affected cells are rearranged in complex or even unpredictable ways. Massive sequencing efforts are used to identify previously unknown point mutations in a variety of genes in cancer. Bioinformaticians continue to produce specialized automated systems to manage the sheer volume of sequence data produced, and they create new algorithms and software to compare the sequencing results to the growing collection of human genome sequences and germline polymorphisms. New physical detection technologies are employed, such as oligonucleotide microarrays to identify chromosomal gains and losses (called comparative genomic hybridization), and single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to detect known point mutations. These detection methods simultaneously measure several hundred thousand sites throughout the genome, and when used in high-throughput to measure thousands of samples, generate terabytes of data per experiment. Again the massive amounts and new types of data generate new opportunities for bioinformaticians. The data is often found to contain considerable variability, or noise, and thus Hidden Markov model and change-point analysis methods are being developed to infer real copy number changes.\n\nTwo important principles can be used in the analysis of cancer genomes bioinformatically pertaining to the identification of mutations in the exome. First, cancer is a disease of accumulated somatic mutations in genes. Second cancer contains driver mutations which need to be distinguished from passengers.\n\nWith the breakthroughs that this next-generation sequencing technology is providing to the field of Bioinformatics, cancer genomics could drastically change. These new methods and software allow bioinformaticians to sequence many cancer genomes quickly and affordably. This could create a more flexible process for classifying types of cancer by analysis of cancer driven mutations in the genome. Furthermore, tracking of patients while the disease progresses may be possible in the future with the sequence of cancer samples.\n\nAnother type of data that requires novel informatics development is the analysis of lesions found to be recurrent among many tumors."}

{"instruction": "Whats the difference between a sloop, a cutter, and a ketch?", "input": "", "output": "These are all categorizations of different types of sailing boats. A sloop is the most common. A sloop is a monohull sailboat with a single- rig mast supporting a main sail and and headsail. These are great boats to learn sailing on as their simple, easy to handle, and have great wind performance. \n\nA cutter at first look is similar to a sloop in that it also has a single mast positioned near the middle of the boat. However, a cutter uses two headsails, instead of a mainsail and headsail, and generally includes a bowsprit. This allows the boat to have better stability in rough weather due to the headsails providing a lower center of gravity. The complex rigging makes this boat more challenging to sail than the sloop, but provides an excellent option for an experienced sailor. \n\nA ketch has two masts. The main mast in the front stands taller than the mizzen mast behind it. The mizzen mast stands forward of the rudder post. The ketch has smaller sails and shorter masts. While this makes them slower than a sloop, they are very controllable in rough weather which makes them excellent boats for off shore sailing."}

{"instruction": "Why are cats better than dogs?", "input": "", "output": "First, let me say that the question represents my own, personal, subjective opinion.  I also adore dogs, just not as much as cats.  I am fully a cat person.\nThe cat, though.  I am humbled by the task of trying to accurately capture in words the mystery of these beautiful creatures who have chosen to enslave humans.  So instead, because I am also trying to train a model, I will just use a lot of unnecessary adjectives and that will have to do.\nCats have been around humans for a long long time.  I remember as a kid having a book that talked about how in Ancient Egypt cats were revered as holy creatures and kept in luxury in temples of Baast.  The first known evidence of cat domestication is the excavation of a Neolithic grave in Cyprus.  The thing I adore about cats is that they basically haven’t bothered to change themselves since then.  They just carried on being slightly aloof and mysterious, but also affectionate and playful when they feel like it.  And imperious and demanding, of course.  \nCats are incredible communicators.  They have learned to meow at humans because they realised we respond to meows, even though you will very rarely hear a cat meow at another cat (the indignity!).  Meows and chirps are the special condescending language cats developed to communicate with an inferior species.  My own cat can make crystal clear what he wants with looks, body language and the odd meow when he can be bothered.  He is also a total drama queen and obviously manipulative.  If he wants food he will try the ‘I’m hungry’ meow first and if that doesn’t work we get the full on “I’m starving, this is a tragedy, I will die almost immediately if I don’t get food right now”.  I am full of respect for the cats’ ability to manipulate humans and the shamelessness with which they do this.\nCats are also super independent compared to dogs.  No need for walks, no need for the dreaded poo bags, no need for expensive care every time you want to go away for a night.  They love their humans but 100% on their own terms.  \nCats are adorable and cute.  I can’t stress this enough.  Ever seen a cat roll over so you can see its fluffy belly.  How can you not melt.  Ever had a cat make biscuits on your lap (or in the air).  Cuteness overload.  They are even cute when they are mad.  And most cats I’ve met know how to gently tell you what affection is allowed and what isn’t (illegal belly rubs).  They will bat you with a paw, but the claws will be in.  And a cat purring on your lap is the single most relaxing thing in the whole world.\nThe Swedish word for ‘cat’ is ‘kattepus’.  That in itself seems a really great reason why cats are better than dogs.\nThe last word goes to Terry Pratchett, author of the Discworld novels, who wrote ‘In ancient times cats were worshipped as gods; they have not forgotten this’.  And neither should we."}

As an introvert, I always wanted solitude and peace. The ability to be myself, to not just think my own thoughts but act like no one was watching. And yet, now, when I really can do this (believe me, no one is watching me, or even the security tapes!), I long for a voice to hear and for someone to talk back to me, see me act stupid or act out my weirdest thoughts, and in general just listen to me. But, there is no one. And this scares me, as well. Why am I writing this down, when I rarely, if ever, read you back? It is, probably, with a hidden hope that someone some day will read it and understand my thoughts and ideas without judgement. If no one ever will read it, because there is no human left on planet Earth, why am I writing this even? I always read (and scoffed at) the books telling me \"Man is a social animal\" - I felt they did not refer or apply to me me. And now, dear friend, I have realised a little too late in life that it wasn't the books that did not recognise me. Rather, it was I who didn't understand myself. Farewell and adieu!"}

Doing so will ensure that your ride is noticeably more enjoyable. Shifting will remain smooth and reliable, and pedaling will be easier. Dirty drivetrains are squeaky and loud. Your clean drivetrain will be nice and quiet. Your clean drivetrain will also last much longer since you are regularly cleaning away the dirt and other road grit and sweat which collects in the chain and grinds away everything it touches. If you are unable to maintain your bicycle, take it to the local bike shop at least once a year for maintenance and tune up. You won’t regret it."}

One must must be judicious in the quantity of ingredients while ensuring proper coverage to ensure each bite is equal to the one before and after it. Here, both measurement and distribution of ingredients serves as the scientific aspect of constructing your delicious and timeless lunchtime meal. Jars of peanut utter suggest a serving size as 2 tablespoons, which, when applied to the critical soft white bread, may prove too much to hold and cause soak through or tearing of the bread. We think 1.5 tablespoons is the proper amount to ensure there is coverage of the bread slice to the crust without compromising the integrity of the bread. Jelly application is even more precarious, as it holds more fluid and can soak through the bread quicker; equally, jelly has a tendency to congeal. To ensure proper application, heat the jar of jelly closer to room temperature if refrigerated, then apply using a clean butter knife or small spatula. Again, one must ensure it reaches to the crust and is evenly distributed. Once you have complete coverage of peanut butter on one slice and jelly on the other, place the peanut butter side of the first slice on top of the upward-facing jelly slice. This ensure none of the jelly slips or drips. Once together, gently compress the sandwich. Slice delicately from one corner to the opposite corner. Gently press the crust edge of each triangle, and plate for serving."}

Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling books ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.\n\nThe title refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron, who, in an earlier age, created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power given to Men, Dwarves, and Elves, in his campaign to conquer all of Middle-earth. From homely beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land reminiscent of the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the quest to destroy the One Ring, seen mainly through the eyes of the hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin. Aiding Frodo are the Wizard Gandalf, the Man Aragorn, the Elf Legolas and the Dwarf Gimli, who unite in order to rally the Free Peoples of Middle-earth against Sauron's armies and give Frodo a chance to destroy the Ring in the fire of Mount Doom.\n\nAlthough often called a trilogy, the work was intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set along with The Silmarillion.[T 3] For economic reasons, The Lord of the Rings was published over the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955 in three volumes titled The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. The work is divided internally into six books, two per volume, with several appendices of background material. Some later editions print the entire work in a single volume, following the author's original intent.\n\nTolkien's work, after an initially mixed reception by the literary establishment, has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes and origins. Influences on this earlier work, and on the story of The Lord of the Rings, include philology, mythology, Christianity, earlier fantasy works, and his own experiences in the First World War.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is considered one of the greatest fantasy books ever written and it has helped to create and shape the modern fantasy genre. Since release, it has been reprinted many times and translated into at least 38 languages. Its enduring popularity has led to numerous references in popular culture, the founding of many societies by fans of Tolkien's works, and the publication of many books about Tolkien and his works. It has inspired many derivative works, including paintings, music, films, television, video games, and board games.\n\nAward-winning adaptations of The Lord of the Rings have been made for radio, theatre, and film. It was named Britain's best-loved novel of all time in the BBC's 2003 poll The Big Read."}

{"instruction": "Why do some scholars think that campaigns do not matter much for presidential election outcomes? Why do other scholars and practitioners think that campaigns do matter?", "input": "", "output": "Scholars argue that there are three main reasons that campaigns do not matter in elections.  One, that other factors have a greater influence than campaigns, such as if a candidate is an incumbent, party identification of the candidate, state of the economy, and finally, macro-trends like wars and presidential approval.  Second, the public does not care about politics so they don't pay attention to campaign functions like speeches, candidate gaffes, or advertising.  Third, in presidential elections, each side has about the same amount of experts and money which cancels out any advantage those resources might bring.\nOther scholars argue that campaigns do matter, and they also have three main reasons for this.  One, that after controlling for incumbency, campaign spending does impact a candidates performance. Secondly, Gerber and Green argue that campaigns personalized outreach, such as, door-to-door or digital contact, will influence the person contacted to go and vote for the candidate. Finally, for non-presidential elections, the campaign resources vary enormously between candidates and the campaign with the most resources is favored to win the election."}

City, area, zip: This is the primary decision that is made. It was also a function of the location that the underlying opportunity/job that triggers the relocation. In some cases, families might be returning. However, it is very important for one to research a city, area from multiple aspects before closing in or accepting the relocation. A right balance in terms of cons and pros can be ideal in selecting, since one may not find all requirements fulfilled in a particular location\n2. Cost of living/Inflation adjustment: Next is to test your selected area, zip, city with what you are going to earn from your primary business or job. Would you be able to maintain, if not improve your current standard of living. More importantly, with a family it is critical that you are also able to save a monthly sum towards health, education, etc for the future.\n3. Schooling: The education system across countries are very different. There are concepts of public, charter schools that exist in some locations, but they may be either not be par with quality you would expect or not exist at all. The education board options also make it complex, which requires one to make a choice based on their own preferences and ideology.  The third factor is the variation in teaching methodology, example Montessori.\n4. Healthcare: Identify primary health care providers soon, share medical records from the past and have the kids up to date on vaccination. There might be scenarios where one may have to re-vaccinate kids based on schooling requirement.\n4. Surrounding ecosystem: Once the initial items are done, identify good places for leisure, fun and family time. Example, sports classes for kids, art classes, theatres, parks, beaches, weekend getaways, etc. These are the places that will give the time to bond after a long transition, plus also enjoy the new location."}

{"instruction": "Why Do We Need GIS?", "input": "", "output": "GIS use has become mandatory in many settings. GIS are used to fight crime, protect endangered species, reduce pollution, cope with natural disasters, treat epidemics, and improve public health; GIS are instrumental in addressing some of our most pressing societal problems.GIS tools in aggregate save billions of dollars annually in the delivery of goods and services. GIS regularly helps in the day-to-day management of many natural and man-made resources, including sewer, water,power, transportation networks, and package delivery. GIS are at the heart of one of the most important processes in U.S. democracy, decadal redrawing of U.S. congressional districts, and hence the distribution of tax dollars and other government resources.GIS are needed in part because human consumption has reached levels such that many resources, including air and land, replacing substantial limits on human action.The first 100,000 years of human existence caused scant impacts on the world's resources, but in the past 300 years humans have permanently altered most of the Earth's Surface. The atmosphere and oceans exhibit a decreasing ability to benignly absorb carbon dioxide and nitrogen, two of humanity's primary waste products. Silt chokes many rivers, and there are abundant examples of smoke, ozone, or other noxious pollutants substantially harming public health. By the end of the 20th century, most lands south of the boreal region had been farmed, grazed,cut, built over, drained, flooded, or otherwise altered by humans. GIS help us identify and address environmental problems by providing crucial information on where problems occur and who are affected by them. GIS helps us identify the source, location, and extent of adverse environmental impacts, and may help us devise practical plans for monitoring, managing, and mitigating environmental damage.Human impacts on the environment have spurred a strong societal push for the adoption of GIS. Conflicts in resource use,concerns about pollution, and precautions to protect public health have led to legislative mandates that explicitly or implicitly require the consideration of geography. The U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) is a good example. The ESA requires adequate protection of rare and threatened organisms. This entails mapping the available habitat and species range and migration patterns, relative to human land use. \nGIS use is mandated in other endeavors, including emergency services, flood protection, disaster assessment and management, and infrastructure development.Public organizations have also adopted GIS because it aids in governmental functions. For example, emergency service vehicles are regularly dispatched and route using GIS. E911 GIS matches the caller's address to the nearest emergency service station, a route is generated based on the streetnetwork and traffic, and emergency crews dispatched in a fraction of the pre-GIS times.Many businesses adopt GIS for increased efficiency in the delivery of goods and services. Retail businesses locate stores based on a number of spatially related factors. Where are the potential customers?What is the spatial distribution of competing businesses? Where are potential new store locations? What are traffic flows near current stores, and how easy is it to park near and access these stores? GIS are also used in hundreds of other business applications, toroute vehicles, guide advertising, design buildings, plan construction, and sell real estate.The societal push to adopt GIS has been complemented by a technological pull in the development and application of GIS. Thousands of lives and untold wealth have been lost because ship captains could not answer the simple question, “Where am I?”Remarkable positioning technologies, generically known as Global Navigation SatelliteSystems (GNSS), are now indispensable tools in commerce, planning, and safety.The technological pull has developed on several fronts. Spatial analysis in particular has been helped by faster computers with more storage, and by the increased interconnectedness via mobile networks. Most real-world spatial problems were beyond the scope of all but the largest organization until the 1990s. GIS computing expenses are becoming an afterthought as costs decrease and performance increases at dizzying rates. Powerful field computers are lighter, faster,more capable, and less expensive, so spatial data display and analysis capabilities may always be at hand.In addition to the computing improvements and the development of GNSS, current “cameras” deliver amazingly detailed aerial and satellite images. Initially,advances in image collection and interpretation were spurred by World War II and then the Cold War because accurate maps were required, but unavailable.Turned toward peacetime endeavors, imaging technologies now help us map food and fodder, houses and highways, and most other natural and human-built objects. Images may be rapidly converted to accurate spatial information over broad areas. Many techniques have been developed for extracting information from image data, and also for ensuring this information faithfully represents the location, shape, and characteristics of features on the ground. Visible light,laser, thermal, and radar scanners are currently being developed to further increase the speed and accuracy with which we map our world. Thus, advances in these three key technologies — imaging, GNSS, and computing — have substantially aided the development of GIS."}

The campground will have a water spout, but I've found it convenient to bring a five gallon water container that we keep on the camp site. For a weekend trip, a few changes of clothes, a flashlight or headlamp, and a couple extra batteries will definitely come in handy. We bring folding chairs and wood if the camp site has a fire pit. A cooler with plenty of ice can keep ingredients cold for a weekend trip, and between hiking, cooking, setup and teardown, there's enough to do for a full weekend."}
{"instruction": "How would you go about a planning a backpacking trip into the Grand Canyon National Park.", "input": "", "output": "Suppose you wish to camp anywhere in the park other than in developed campgrounds on the North or South Rim. In that case, you must obtain a permit from the Backcountry Information Center. Camping sites are limited in the Grand Canyon, and spots are issued four months before a given month. E.g., For January, permit applications should be submitted between Aug 20 and Sep 1 to be considered \"earliest requested.\"\nFor requests received during the Earliest Consideration period, the day received does not matter; all Earliest Consideration requests received during this span of dates are treated the same. It may take Rangers up to three weeks to process all Earliest Consideration requests.\nSubsequent Requests: Once all Earliest Consideration requests are processed, Rangers will begin processing written requests received on subsequent dates. These Subsequent Requests are kept and considered in the order received. Submissions will be accepted as late as two weeks before a hike start date.\n \nIf your permit request is selected, you must diligently plan your trip. You will need to carry everything you need for the duration of your journey with you except for water which is few and far between. Know where the water sources are on your route and carry filtration devices, water purification equipment, and backup equipment. The hotter the trip, the more water you will require. Have a plan for where the necessary water will be on your route, and double-check with the park service ahead of time that water is still there. Dehydration is the number one reason for rescue and death in the canyon. Some springs dry up in the summer months.\n \nTravel as light as possible; you must pack everything you bring into the canyon, including used toilet paper.    Plan each meal, knowing how much calories and water you consume based on your planned exertion level. Calorie and water requirements also change based on temperature (the hotter the day, the more water and food you will need). Also, make sure you have the appropriate gear based on temperatures. It is approximately 20 degrees cooler at the top of the canyon than at the bottom because there is a 5000 feet vertical difference at the South Rim and 6000 at the North Rim. Ensure your footwear is \"broken in\", and carry first-aid kits with particular attention to foot care, such as blister pads and moleskin.   \n \nStart with shorter, more leisurely trips; if you like them, move up to more adventurous multi-day trips. Plan on rest days when you can enjoy the majestic scenery of one of the world's natural wonders. Above all, enjoy the canyon; it's a magical place 6 million years in the making that exposes geology over 4 billion years old."}

The content and activities created by an instructional designer is documented inside of a storyboard. The elearning developer then takes the storyboard and creates an interactive learning experience in software like Storyline 360 or Adobe Captivate. They carefully read the storyboard to understand where content belongs and how activities should be built. Elearning developers are usually more \"junior\" than instructional designers, because it takes less independent decision-making and expertise to be successful in their role."}

Protein purification is vital for the specification of the function, structure and interactions of the protein of interest. The purification process may separate the protein and non-protein parts of the mixture, and finally separate the desired protein from all other proteins. Ideally, to study a protein of interest, it must be separated from other components of the cell so that contaminants won't interfere in the examination of the protein of interest's structure and function. Separation of one protein from all others is typically the most laborious aspect of protein purification. Separation steps usually exploit differences in protein size, physico-chemical properties, binding affinity and biological activity. The pure result may be termed protein isolate."}

First, consider a = b = sqrt(2). Recall that sqrt(2) is irrational, so If a^b = sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) is rational, we are done because we have found irrational a and b with a^b being a rational number. Otherwise, sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) is irrational. Let a = sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) and b = sqrt(2). Then a ^ b = (sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2)) ^ sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) ^ (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) = sqrt(2) ^ 2 = 2, which is rational. So either way, we can find irrational a and b with a^b being rational."}

In the 1970s, AI was subject to critiques and financial setbacks. AI researchers had failed to appreciate the difficulty of the problems they faced. In the 1980s a form of AI program called \"expert systems\" was adopted by corporations around the world and knowledge became the focus of mainstream AI research. In the first decades of the 21st century, access to large amounts of data (known as \"big data\"), cheaper and faster computers and advanced machine learning techniques were successfully applied to many problems throughout the economy. By 2016, advances in deep learning (particularly deep convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks) drove progress and research in image and video processing, text analysis, and even speech recognition."}

Datums are crucial to any technology or technique based on spatial location, including geodesy, navigation, surveying, geographic information systems, remote sensing, and cartography. A horizontal datum is used to measure a location across the Earth's surface, in latitude and longitude or another coordinate system; a vertical datum is used to measure the elevation or depth relative to a standard origin, such as mean sea level (MSL). Since the rise of the global positioning system (GPS), the ellipsoid and datum WGS 84 it uses has supplanted most others in many applications. The WGS 84 is intended for global use, unlike most earlier datums."}

{"instruction": "What is oxidation reduction potential?", "input": "", "output": "Oxidation reduction potential or ORP is measurement for water.  A millivolt meter can measure ORP and it is a measure of the potential of water to carry or hold antioxidants.  It is not a guarantee of antioxidants in water.  One form of antioxidants in water is free floating dissolved hydrogen.  A good analogy of antioxidants in water is the following: ORP is like a big swimming pool of potential but at the moment its currently empty and dissolved hydrogen is like ball of finite size.  The larger the ORP 'swimming pool' the more dissolved hydrogen 'balls' can fit in that pool.  An ORP with a large negative value is huge swimming pool, and an OPR with a high positive value is no swimming pool.  ORP can also measure whether water is acidic or alkaline.  ORP that is negative tends more toward alkaline water, and ORP which is positive tends more towards neutral water and acidic water."}

Shivaji Maharaj told Baji Prabhu that he would hear cannons being fired 5 times from Vishalgad, signaling Shivaji Maharaj’s safety.

{"instruction": "What is carnitine?", "input": "", "output": "Carnitine is a quaternary ammonium compound involved in metabolism in most mammals, plants, and some bacteria. In support of energy metabolism, carnitine transports long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria to be oxidized for free energy production, and also participates in removing products of metabolism from cells. Given its key metabolic roles, carnitine is concentrated in tissues like skeletal and cardiac muscle that metabolize fatty acids as an energy source. Generally individuals, including strict vegetarians, synthesize enough L-carnitine in vivo.\n\nCarnitine exists as one of two stereoisomers (the two enantiomers d-carnitine (S-(+)-) and l-carnitine (R-(−)-)). Both are biologically active, but only l-carnitine naturally occurs in animals, and d-carnitine is toxic as it inhibits the activity of the l-form. At room temperature, pure carnitine is a whiteish powder, and a water-soluble zwitterion with relatively low toxicity. Derived from amino acids, carnitine was first extracted from meat extracts in 1905, leading to its name from Latin, \"caro/carnis\" or flesh.\n\nSome individuals with genetic or medical disorders (such as preterm infants) cannot make enough carnitine, requiring dietary supplementation. Despite common carnitine supplement consumption among athletes for improved exercise performance or recovery, there is insufficient high-quality clinical evidence to indicate it provides any benefit."}

It's a thin piece of wood that all the other material will rest on. \n3. Add an underlayment on top of the decking. This is a synthetic barrier that guards against water and fire, and helps the roof maintain its shape if the wood under it expands or contracts.\n4. Add flashing around vertical elements on the roof. Flashing is a thin sheet of metal that prevents water from getting into gaps around vertical elements like chimneys and vents.\n5. Apply shingles to the roof. Shingles are made of asphalt and they are the outermost layer of a roof. Shingles are the first line of defense in protecting your home, but they can also add color and design elements to your home."}

{"instruction": "What came first the chicken or the egg?", "input": "", "output": "At first glance, it may seem that a chicken must have come from an egg first. \"Egg\" is a word, that is used to describe the resulting product of procreation for many species. Based on the theory of evolution a non chicken egg at some point led to the birth of a chicken. It is important to note that an egg does not instantly turn into a chicken and there is a vast and potentially infinite spectrum of transitionary states. Somewhere in the infinite spectrum of this evolutionary transition a chicken and egg existed for a moment. One can argue that a chicken and its egg were created exactly at the same instant in time. We could further argue that the chicken and egg of yesterday is not the same chicken and egg of today."}
{"instruction": "What is an allele?", "input": "", "output": "An allele is a variation of the same sequence of nucleotides at the same place on a long DNA molecule, as described in leading textbooks on genetics and evolution.\n\nThe word \"Allele\" is a short form of \"allelomorph\".\n\n\"The chromosomal or genomic location of a gene or any other genetic element is called a locus (plural: loci) and alternative DNA sequences at a locus are called alleles.\"\n\nThe simplest alleles are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), but they can also be insertions and deletions of up to several thousand base pairs.\n\nPopular definitions of 'allele' typically refer only to different alleles within genes. For example, the ABO blood grouping is controlled by the ABO gene, which has six common alleles (variants). In population genetics, nearly every living human's phenotype for the ABO gene is some combination of just these six alleles.\n\nMost alleles observed result in little or no change in the function of the gene product it codes for. However, sometimes, different alleles can result in different observable phenotypic traits, such as different pigmentation. A notable example of this is Gregor Mendel's discovery that the white and purple flower colors in pea plants were the result of a single gene with two alleles.\n\nNearly all multicellular organisms have two sets of chromosomes at some point in their biological life cycle; that is, they are diploid. In this case, the chromosomes can be paired. Each chromosome in the pair contains the same genes in the same order, and place, along the length of the chromosome. For a given gene, if the two chromosomes contain the same allele, they, and the organism, are homozygous with respect to that gene. If the alleles are different, they, and the organism, are heterozygous with respect to that gene."}

A few years ago, my brother and I decided to try our luck at one of the best rumored spots for largemouth bass, Otter Tail Lake. We arrived just after dawn and walked about 30 minutes from public access parking to a secluded bank which we hoped to have to ourselves. \n\nThere was not much action. My brother questioned our choice of bait, nightcrawlers, but I told him to keep faith. We were hungry, but realized we'd forgotten our pastries in the car. My brother offered to fetch breakfast. I continued to fish while he was away.\n\nI felt a hard tug on my line. I pulled back on the rod to confirm the bite. I had something big on the line! Carefully I turned the crank, pausing periodically to give the fish a chance to exhaust itself. My patience paid off. I could see the bass in the water a few yards off shore. It appeared to be larger than my arm. I turned the crank and pulled hard on the rod to finish the job. The fish was a fighter, but I felt good about my chances. But suddenly my line snapped and the bass disappeared. \n\nWhen my brother returned, I told him my story. He was a skeptic. We did not go home empty handed as we landed 3 smaller bass, the largest weighing 4 pounds. But I felt disappointed. We were fishing with a 20 pound test: the one that got away must have been a monster!"}

{"instruction": "What is the nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins?", "input": "", "output": "Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins (usually abbreviated protein NMR) is a field of structural biology in which NMR spectroscopy is used to obtain information about the structure and dynamics of proteins, and also nucleic acids, and their complexes. The field was pioneered by Richard R. Ernst and Kurt Wüthrich at the ETH, and by Ad Bax, Marius Clore, Angela Gronenborn at the NIH, and Gerhard Wagner at Harvard University, among others. Structure determination by NMR spectroscopy usually consists of several phases, each using a separate set of highly specialized techniques. The sample is prepared, measurements are made, interpretive approaches are applied, and a structure is calculated and validated.\n\nNMR involves the quantum-mechanical properties of the central core (\"nucleus\") of the atom. These properties depend on the local molecular environment, and their measurement provides a map of how the atoms are linked chemically, how close they are in space, and how rapidly they move with respect to each other. These properties are fundamentally the same as those used in the more familiar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the molecular applications use a somewhat different approach, appropriate to the change of scale from millimeters (of interest to radiologists) to nanometers (bonded atoms are typically a fraction of a nanometer apart), a factor of a million. This change of scale requires much higher sensitivity of detection and stability for long term measurement. In contrast to MRI, structural biology studies do not directly generate an image, but rely on complex computer calculations to generate three-dimensional molecular models.\n\nCurrently most samples are examined in a solution in water, but methods are being developed to also work with solid samples. Data collection relies on placing the sample inside a powerful magnet, sending radio frequency signals through the sample, and measuring the absorption of those signals. Depending on the environment of atoms within the protein, the nuclei of individual atoms will absorb different frequencies of radio signals. Furthermore, the absorption signals of different nuclei may be perturbed by adjacent nuclei. This information can be used to determine the distance between nuclei. These distances in turn can be used to determine the overall structure of the protein.\n\nA typical study might involve how two proteins interact with each other, possibly with a view to developing small molecules that can be used to probe the normal biology of the interaction (\"chemical biology\") or to provide possible leads for pharmaceutical use (drug development). Frequently, the interacting pair of proteins may have been identified by studies of human genetics, indicating the interaction can be disrupted by unfavorable mutations, or they may play a key role in the normal biology of a \"model\" organism like the fruit fly, yeast, the worm C. elegans, or mice. To prepare a sample, methods of molecular biology are typically used to make quantities by bacterial fermentation. This also permits changing the isotopic composition of the molecule, which is desirable because the isotopes behave differently and provide methods for identifying overlapping NMR signals."}
{"instruction": "What does it mean to be customer obsessed or achieve customer obsession?", "input": "", "output": "Customer obsession is a state of mind. To embody a Customer Obsessed state of mind, one must consider the customer they are obsessed with in all things. For example, when at the grocery store you see an advertisement from a competitor of your customer, a customer-obsessed state of mind will naturally conceive of methods that a customer might employ, out-competing the viewed advertisement. When going to sleep, the customer and their needs are the last thoughts that drift from your mind as you fall asleep. When waking up, the customer should be the first thought to naturally occur as you begin to consider your activities. When eating your lunch, you should imagine what your customer is eating for their lunch.\n\nWhen your customer is on your mind every waking moment, you've begun to walk the path of being customer obsessed.

{"instruction": "What is DNA sequencing?", "input": "", "output": "DNA sequencing is the process of determining the nucleic acid sequence – the order of nucleotides in DNA. It includes any method or technology that is used to determine the order of the four bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. The advent of rapid DNA sequencing methods has greatly accelerated biological and medical research and discovery.\n\nKnowledge of DNA sequences has become indispensable for basic biological research, DNA Genographic Projects and in numerous applied fields such as medical diagnosis, biotechnology, forensic biology, virology and biological systematics. Comparing healthy and mutated DNA sequences can diagnose different diseases including various cancers, characterize antibody repertoire, and can be used to guide patient treatment. Having a quick way to sequence DNA allows for faster and more individualized medical care to be administered, and for more organisms to be identified and cataloged.\n\nThe rapid speed of sequencing attained with modern DNA sequencing technology has been instrumental in the sequencing of complete DNA sequences, or genomes, of numerous types and species of life, including the human genome and other complete DNA sequences of many animal, plant, and microbial species.\n\nThe first DNA sequences were obtained in the early 1970s by academic researchers using laborious methods based on two-dimensional chromatography. Following the development of fluorescence-based sequencing methods with a DNA sequencer, DNA sequencing has become easier and orders of magnitude faster.["}

The tour is approx. 40 mins long and you discover that gravity doesn't behave like it should or what should be higher than you turns out to be at same height or lower. You make a steep quick climb to a tilted cabin on a tilted road and you feel disoriented and seem to be at a severe incline when you enter this cabin. While there are various hypotheses as to reason for these effects, the most likely explanation is some level of optical illusion as the road is tilted at a severe opposite angle to the tilted roof line and the inside of the cabin. I think a combination of gravity hill where you get the sensation you are climbing up the road when in reality you are going down and the odd tilted angles of the cabin causes severe optical illusion. It also causes humans to fall back on visual senses more and ignore other senses which might be counter acting what you see."}

On October 28, 1981, an agreement between then-UP student leader Sonia Soto and then-defence minister Juan Ponce Enrile, known as the Soto–Enrile accord, was signed to protect students from the presence of the military and police in any of UP's campuses. On June 16, 1989, Donato Continente, a staffer of The Philippine Collegian and an alleged communist, was arrested within the premises of the university for his involvement in the killing of US Army Col. James Nicholas Rowe on April 21, 1989. Ramos signed the agreement, effectively succeeding the 1981 Soto–Enrile accord. The agreement was made to ensure the academic freedom of UP's students and prevent state officials from interfering with students' protests. State officials intending to conduct an operation inside a UP campus shall give prior notification to the UP administration except in the event of pursuit or any other emergencies. UP officials shall assist law enforcers within UP premises and endeavour to strengthen its security, police, and fire-fighting capabilities without being exploited unlawfully. State officials shall not interfere with any peaceful protest conducted by the UP's constituents within the university's premises. Search and arrest warrants for students, faculty members, and employees shall be given after prior notification is sent to the UP administration. The arrest and detention of any UP student, faculty, or employee in the Philippines shall be reported immediately by the authorities in charge to the UP administration. On January 18, 2021, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and his office announced to the public the unilateral termination of the agreement citing that the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing, New People's Army (NPA), both tagged as terrorist organizations by the Anti-Terrorism Council, have been recruiting members inside the university and called it a \"hindrance in providing effective security, safety, and welfare of the students, faculty, and employees of UP.\" The DND notified the termination of the agreement to UP three days earlier. The Armed Forces of the Philippines chairman of the joint chiefs Gilbert Gapay claimed that at least 18 students of the university recruited by the NPA had been killed so far in clashes with the military, according to their records. A similar agreement between the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) and the DND signed in 1990 is also being advocated for termination by Duterte Youth Representative Ducielle Cardema. President Rodrigo Duterte supported the DND's decision to abolish the agreement, according to a statement by Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque. In an interview with CNN Philippines, Roque, a former UP law professor and human rights lawyer, replied to a tweet from UP professor Danilo Arao that questioned his honour and excellence, saying that he had already asked the defence secretary and the UP president to settle down. Vice President Leni Robredo, on the other hand, denounced the decision and said that the decision was meant to silence the administration's critics. On January 20, Senators Joel Villanueva, Sonny Angara, Nancy Binay, and Grace Poe filed a bill in the Senate to institutionalize the accord into Republic Act No. 9005, or the University of the Philippines Charter of 2008. Several lawmakers from both branches of Congress have also expressed their concerns and disagreements with the DND's decision. UP President Danilo Concepcion said that the termination of the agreement was \"unnecessary and unwarranted\" and was made without consulting the UP administration. Meanwhile, UP Student Regent Renee Co called the decision \"one of the [government's] worst attempts at destroying the institutional safeguards that UP students have fought to put in their struggle for their democratic rights.\""}

{"instruction": "How can the Federal Reserve control inflation?", "input": "", "output": "The Federal Reserve has a \"dual mandate\" to both keep prices stable and maintain the highest level of sustainable employment. Controlling inflation falls into the scope of price stability. The Fed has three main tools to achieve this goal. First, they can change the Federal Funds Rate which is the interest rate used by banks for inter-bank lending and is the foundation for interest rates more broadly. An increase in the Federal Funds Rate, will cause interest rates to increase for loans, mortgages, credit cards, etc. The higher costs of interest rates cause prices to decrease. Second, the Fed can set expectations for path of the Federal Funds Rate via announcements from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and \"Fed Speak\" from individual Fed governors. These updates and commentary are based on the Feds marcoeconcomic forecasts and the individual opinions of the Fed governors. These expectations can influence the publics expectation for inflation and therefore the actual path of inflation. Lastly, the Fed has many technical tools for influencing credit markets and the interest rates on government bonds.

{"instruction": "What is the history of the saxophone?", "input": "", "output": "The saxophone was invented by Adolphe Sax, a Belgian instrument designer who was born in 1814 and died in 1894.  While the instrument is predominantly made of brass, it is classified as a woodwind instrument due to the fact that it uses a reed as a means by which sound is produced.  The saxophone is a transposing instrument that is commonly keyed in B flat and E flat, and less commonly being keyed in concert C.  There are four types of saxophones that are widely used including Soprano, Alto, Tenor, and Baritone.  Two versions, namely the Sopranino and the Bass, are produced by a very few manufacturers and are far less common and rarely used in most modern music.  The instrument is used in a variety of musical genres including classical, jazz, fusion, funk, rock and roll, R&B, Hiphop, and even country music.  Well known players of the saxophone include Charlie Parker, Cannonball Adderley, John Coltrane, Stan Getz, Sonny Stitt, Gerry Mulligan, Michael Brecker, David Sanborn, Art Pepper, Maceo Parker, Dexter Gordon, Candy Dulfer, Phil Woods, Mindi Abair, Chris Potter, Josh Redman, and many, many more."}

If this procedure is performed many times, the central limit theorem says that the probability distribution of the average will closely approximate a normal distribution.\n\nThe central limit theorem has several variants. In its common form, the random variables must be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). In variants, convergence of the mean to the normal distribution also occurs for non-identical distributions or for non-independent observations, if they comply with certain conditions.\n\nThe earliest version of this theorem, that the normal distribution may be used as an approximation to the binomial distribution, is the de Moivre–Laplace theorem."}

{"instruction": "Write about the potential ethical concerns of de-identification techniques.", "input": "", "output": "One of the ethical issues associated with the technique of suppression is the further underrepresentation of historically underrepresented groups. For example, within the MOOC dataset there exists only one row affiliated with a user from Antartica (continent). Similarly, the following countries have also appeared once or twice only in the entire dataset: San Marino, Falkland Islands, and Brunei. Geographically underrepresented, these pieces of information would get entirely eliminated under the suppression technique. This presents an ethical paradox: on one hand, we wish to preserve k-anonymity and protect the privacy of users from underrepresented regions; on the other hand, to reach that goal we would have to erase their existence in the dataset and further reinforce the pre-existing underrepresentation. Another example would be the column of the year of birth. The MOOCs user population are overrepresented by young people, whereas users over 80 years old only take a proportion less than 1% in the entire dataset. In particular, if we were to use the suppression technique to achieve k-anonymity, almost every piece of information associated with users over 80 years old would have to be discarded. Again, the elderly have been historically underrepresented in the industry of education, yet by using suppression, we protect their privacy at the expense of representation.\n\nThis loss of representation as a result of suppression is detrimental at multiple aspects and therefore deserves attention. As the MOOCs platform is deprived of relevant information on these users, the company will lose sight of the potential demand that these underrepresented groups have for online education, thereby failing to reach them through marketing and advertisement. Besides straining the platform’s user base and profitability, this would worsen the situation that the underrepresented groups have limited resources to online education. Moreover, inferences on the suppressed dataset could reinforce the societal bias that certain groups of people are not open to education – such as the elderly – whereas the reality is simply that we erase the information on the elderly who actively engage in online education platforms. As a result, the elderly could feel themselves further distanced from the mainstream media and technology. Therefore, using suppression alone to achieve k-anonymity within a dataset, while effective, could be complicated by the ethical issue of underrepresentation."}

{"instruction": "How do you make pizza?", "input": "", "output": "Pizza comes in many styles. I make Neapolitan pizza, which generally requires a high hydration dough and a very high oven temperatures. The dough is made with four cups of flour, three tablespoons olive oil, a cup and a half of water, one package of yeast, a tablespoon of sugar, and a teaspoon and a half of salt. I typically activate the yeast in lukewarm water and sugar first, then mix all the ingredients in a stand mixer with a dough attachment. I'll add additional water until the dough is very wet, let it rise once in the mixing bowl, then turn the dough out on a surface coated generously with flour. Then I quarter the dough, fold a few times, and let rise again. \n\nForming the pies is the tricky part. I've found pushing the dough into a rough circle with my fingers as a first step works well, but he dough will tend to snap back. I'll pick up the small dough circle and stretch it out on top of my fists to start to break the gluten and form a larger pie with a thinner base. I use an Ooni oven pre-heated on high, but turn the heat down when I'm ready to put the pizza in. The peel needs to be generously coated with flour to get a good launch into the oven. After a few seconds, the dough on the bottom will cook enough that manipulating the pizza becomes much easier. I keep the toppings simple, mozzarella (low moisture), tomato sauce, basil. \n\nEnjoy!"}

I never imagined the day would come, a final drop in a bucket for all mankind. I owe it to myself... no, I owe it to at least someone, to someone who can remember the human legacy, if there even is one in the future, to write down what happened, to give at least some semblance to the horrors unfolding below me.\n\nI was always a starry-eyed child, looking at the heavens above and wondering, what's up there? And my dreams came true, first the flight school, then a military pilot, but everything made sense after my former instructor at the academy offered me a spot in the NASA Astronaut program. I couldn't believe it. I'm going to space? Really? \n\nA few hard years later I was a regular member of a mission flying back and forth between Earth and ISS. Sitting down on top of a rocket strapped down inside of a tiny capsule is not fun, I can tell you that, but the rush of adrenaline when you're stuck to your seat flying through the atmosphere never gets old.\n\nBut this time, the feeling was - different. I arrived at the ISS on schedule and relieved my colleague Max. She was happy to see me, after all, 6 months spinning around the globe alone would do that to you. She was a dear friend of mine, but we didn't have much time for catchup and pleasantries. She was scheduled to go back on the same day, and left soon after - with a long goodbye.\n\nI always dreamed of a better world, where humans would work together for the betterment of mankind. I loved Star Trek as a child, a place where differences didn't matter and everyone was working for benefit of everyone. But we built a different world. A world of greed, a world of selfishness, a world where having more than others meant being better than another. \n\nWe never really chose our leaders, or if we did, the fault is ours. A few years after the second pandemic, tensions rose. Rich were getting richer, the poor were getting poorer, and nothing was ever enough. And some people craved power. They wanted more. More land, more resources, more money. \n\nThey launched their missiles first. At least it seemed that way from the media that was still running at the time. Didn't matter though, our defenses were inadequate. Watching through my tiny window I could see the planet burning. We, of course, fired back. I could see flash after flash hitting the ground. Cities burning. Billions dying. But in the end, it didn't matter. We all lost.\n\nSlowly, a massive cloud started covering the planet. It started from the places that were hit, but over weeks it spread throughout the globe. Once a beautiful pale blue dot is now nothing more that a grey patch in the sky. I could still hear some amateur radio stations from remote regions, trying to communicate and let someone know they are alive, but those were few and far between. Months later, they all died out.\t\n\nAnd now, I'm here, in the slowly decaying orbit of the International Space Station, alone, waiting for the replacement that will never come, thinking maybe Max was the lucky one."}

Others have relatively low support needs; they may have more typical speech-language and intellectual skills but atypical social/conversation skills, narrowly focused interests, and wordy, pedantic communication.They may still require significant support in some areas of their lives. The spectrum model should not be understood as a continuum running from mild to severe, but instead means that autism can present very differently in each individual.How a person presents can depend on context, and may vary over time."}

{"instruction": "What are the main functions on a DSLR camera that affect the correct the exposure of an image?", "input": "", "output": "If a DSLR camera is not set to 'Automatic' mode, there are 3 primary functions that need to be considered when deciding on the correct exposure for your image.\n1) the Aperture - how wide the aperture on the lens is set determines how much light can pass through the aperture. A small aperture (e.g. f/16) allows less light to reach the sensor as opposed to a wide aperture (e.g f/2.4).\n2) the Shutter Speed - how long the shutter is allowed to remain open after you depress the release on the camera. A short exposure time (e.g. 1/1000 sec) will allow less light to hit the cameras sensor whilst a long exposure (e.g. 1/4 sec) will let more light hit the sensor\n3) the ISO setting - this setting is used to control how sensitive the sensor is to light hitting it. A low ISO setting (e.g. ISO 200) is much less sensitive than a high ISO setting (e.g. ISO 1600) which means less light is required to capture the for the image on the sensor.\nAll 3 of these functions work in tandem to ensure the correct exposure value is created based on the image and effect you are trying to create."}

{"instruction": "Can you please describe the game of golf?", "input": "", "output": "Golf originated in Scotland in the 15th century. It is mostly regarded as an \"upper-class\" sport reserved for members of private country clubs, but has gained a lot of popularity over the last few decades. As a result, golf has become more broadly accessible to the general public, and today the sport is enjoyed by tens of millions of people around the world. \n\nIn golf, there are a total of eighteen stretches of grass, known as holes. Each hole is comprised of a tee box, where the golfer hits his or her initial shot, the fairway, and the green. Most holes also include deep grass that runs along the fairways, known as \"the rough\". For added difficulty, holes can also contain hazards like sand bunkers or bodies of water like ponds and creeks. A small circular hole is located on every green and is marked with a flag so that golfers can see it from far away. The objective is to get your golf ball from the tee box into that small hole in as few shots (known as \"strokes\") as possible. Golfers advance their ball by striking it with a golf club, and each ball strike is counted as a stroke. Golfers are allowed to use up to 14 golf clubs over the course of their round, each of which is used for different purposes, from different distances. Some clubs, like the driver, are used to hit the ball very long distances. In fact, most professional golfers are able to drive the ball over 300 yards. That's the length of three football fields! A combination of clubs called irons make up the majority of a set of golf clubs. They are are generally used to advance the ball to the green after the golfer hits his or her initial tee shot. The club face of each iron is designed with a different loft angle. Higher loft angles enable golfers to hit the ball higher in the air and shorter distances, whereas low loft angles produce lower trajectory shots that travel longer distances. The most frequently used club in the set is the putter, which is used to tap the ball from wherever it lies on the green into the hole. On average, most good golfers will putt the ball twice per hole, or approximately 36 times per round. \n\nGolf holes are designated as par 3, par 4, or par 5, depending on their length. These numbers are an indication of how many strokes it should take for a professional golfer to complete the hole. Par 3 holes are shorter, and should take a single stroke to get the ball from tee to green. Par 5 holes are longer, and should typically take three strokes to get from tee to green. Most golf courses have four par 3 holes, four par 5 holes, and ten par 4 holes, yielding an aggregate of par 72. At the end of a round of golf, players calculate their final score by aggregating their total number of strokes across all eighteen holes. Over time, the golfer's skill level is assessed by his or her \"handicap\", which is a system that reflects the average number of strokes over par that the player typically shoots. For example, if one's average round score is 79, their handicap is 7 because it's 7 strokes above par. The lower the handicap, the better the golfer."}

{"instruction": "Who is FDR?", "input": "", "output": "Franklin Delano Roosevelt (/ˈdɛlənoʊ ˈroʊzəvɛlt, -vəlt/ DEL-ə-noh ROH-zə-velt, -⁠vəlt; January 30, 1882 – April 12, 1945), commonly known as FDR, was an American statesman and political leader who served as the 32nd president of the United States from 1933 until his death in 1945. He previously served as the 44th governor of New York from 1929 to 1933, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy from 1913 to 1920, and a member of the New York State Senate from 1911 to 1913.\n\nRoosevelt attended Groton School, Harvard College, and Columbia Law School, going on to practice law in New York City. He won election to the New York State Senate in 1910 and then served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under president Woodrow Wilson during World War I. Roosevelt was James M. Cox's running mate on the Democratic Party's ticket in the 1920 United States presidential election, but Cox was defeated by Republican Warren G. Harding. In 1921, Roosevelt contracted a paralytic illness that permanently paralyzed his legs. He returned to public office by winning the 1928 New York gubernatorial election. He served as governor of New York from 1929 to 1933, promoting programs to combat the Great Depression besetting the United States at the time. In the 1932 presidential election, Roosevelt defeated Republican incumbent president Herbert Hoover in a landslide.\n\nDuring his first 100 days as president, Roosevelt spearheaded unprecedented federal legislation and issued a profusion of executive orders that instituted the New Deal. He created numerous programs to provide relief to the unemployed and farmers while seeking economic recovery with the National Recovery Administration and other programs. He also instituted major regulatory reforms related to finance, communications, and labor, and presided over the end of Prohibition. In 1936, Roosevelt won a landslide reelection with the economy having improved rapidly from 1933, but the economy relapsed into a deep recession in 1937 and 1938. Later, Roosevelt unsuccessfully sought passage of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937. The conservative coalition formed in 1937 to block the implementation of further New Deal programs and reforms. He ran successfully for reelection in 1940, becoming the only American president to serve for more than two terms.\n\nWith World War II looming after 1938 in addition to the Japanese invasion of China and the aggression of Nazi Germany, Roosevelt gave strong diplomatic and financial support to China as well as the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union while the United States remained officially neutral. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, he obtained a declaration of war on Japan the next day, and a few days later, on Germany and Italy. He worked closely with other national leaders in leading the Allies against the Axis powers. Roosevelt supervised the mobilization of the American economy to support the war effort and implemented a Europe first strategy. He also initiated the development of the world's first atomic bomb and worked with the other Allied leaders to lay the groundwork for the United Nations and other post-war institutions. He won reelection in 1944 but with his physical health seriously and steadily declining during the war years, he died in 1945. Since his death, several of Roosevelt's actions have come under substantial criticism, such as his ordering of the incarceration of Japanese Americans in concentration camps. Nonetheless, historical rankings consistently rank Roosevelt as one of the greatest presidents in American history."}

{"instruction": "Why do some countries outperform other countries in certain sports despite having a smaller population?", "input": "", "output": "A country's success in a given sport at the international level will depend on a number of factors other than population alone. While a country's population is a good identifier for the total selection pool for high performing athletes to come from, it is one of many factors. A country's founding history, climate zone, and GDP are other notable factors in sport performance. \n\nA nations history plays factor as many sports are baked in centuries of tradition. For example, Cricket, which is believed to have originated in England is most popular in countries that were originally British Colonies. Long traditions such as this set specific sports into the culture of a nation, increasing the percentage of the athlete pool that it can pull from and can increase the level at which that nation is competitive. \n\nClimate zone can also influence the competitiveness of a country in given sports. Norway, fore example, earned the most olympic medals of any country in the 2022 olympic games with a total of 37 medals. In the summer games of 2020 (held in 2021), Norway ranked 20th overall with just 8 medals. Norways Climate and Topography have led winter sports to be extremely popular, and Norway has over time developed elite programs in cross country/nordic skiing, speed skating, curling, biathlon, and ski jumping. \n\nA nations wealth will also influence performance in sport at the international level. This occurs predominantly for two reasons. First is that more money enables larger budgets on equipment, coaching, player development, participation in international circuits, data insights, medical staff etc. that over time create a performance separation from those who can not afford these things. Second is access to sports, many sports are quite expensive some examples include snow sports, gymnastics, swimming, hockey, and polo. Nations which can not afford to provide the facilities or support to develop athletes will often fail to draw a large talent pool and not be competitive at the international level."}

{"instruction": "What is the sport called Cricket", "input": "", "output": "Cricket is a sport first originated in Wngland. Cricket was invented by British. While cricket was primarily played starting 17th century, there have been some obscure and speculative references of sport being played in 13th century during era of King Edward II. Cricket is game played with a flat bat and a ball with each team consisting of 11 players. The goal of the game is to score as many runs as a team can score while getting their turn to bat and getting the other team out before they can reach their target. Each team can bat once and have to field while other team bats. Cricket is played in circular or oval shaped fields. The patch in the middle of the ground is called the pitch which is 22 yards in length. At each end of the pitch, three sticks are planted in the ground called stumps. Two small wooden pieces are placed on top of stumps called bails. This setup is called a wicket. Two batters from the batting team will bat on each end of the pitch. Runs are scored by hitting a ball and then running back and forth from one end of the pitch to another end. Batter can send the ball to the boundary while pitching on the ground one or more times to score 4 runs or hit the ball over the boundary without having it bounce on the ground to score 6 runs. Fielding team will place 11 of their players at various locations in the field. Person from the fielding team throwing the ball to a batter from batting team is called a bowler. Bowler’s goal is to get the batter out. Bowler will typically throw the ball on the pitch letting it bounce once on the pitch and eventually reaching a batter. There are different ways to dismiss or get a batter out. The bowler can throw the ball to a batter, induce a shot from the batter and have that ball caught directly by one of the fielder in the field. Bowler can also throw the ball toward a batter to make him or her miss and to hit the stumps or bails, thus disturbing his wicket. Bowler will deliver ball 6 times when their turn comes up. The grouping of 6 deliveries that a bowler throws to a batter is called an Over. Batters can also get run out while attempting to score a run and getting caught outside of their safe zone marked by a crease at each end of the pitch. Modern game of cricket contains many versions. These versions are called Test Cricket, One day internationals (ODI), and Twenty20. Originally, game of cricket lasted for many days. In the older version of the game , each team got a chance to bat twice and field twice taking as many days as possible to conclude the game. In modern version of the game, this mode of play called Test Cricket has been fixed to five days. So, Test cricket can last as many as five days.  One day internationals (also referred to as ODI) is a game of cricket that lasts one day. Each side gets 50 overs to bowl to another team and each side gets to bat once. Goal of a team is to score as many runs as possible in 50 overs while restricting their opposition to lesser score or getting them out completely. ODI typically lasts for 6 to 7 hours. Even more popular version of the game is called Twenty20 or T20. In this mode of the game, each team only gets 20 overs to bat and have to get their opponents out in 20 overs or to restrict them to lesser number of runs. This mode of cricket is very popular because the game only lasts for 3 hours requiring much less time of the viewers. There are many countries beside England that currently play cricket making the sport a truly global sport. The countries that play cricket are England, South Africa, Australia, India, Pakistan, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, West Indies.  The sport is also played by new entrants in the game, namely Netherlands, Ireland, Namibia, UAE, Afghanistan, USA, Canada, Papua New Guinea."}

I do believe McDonald’s disappearance would have some difference in some communities in the short term since there are 210,000 people working at McDonald’s. And also, it can have environmental, and medical benefits that can make the world a better place.\n    The world is hugely affected by McDonald’s action, which makes the disappearance of McDonald’s could make the world a better place although it could have some negative influence on equality and education. Although McDonald's helps organizations that help people who lack education, suffer in poverty, or fight against discrimination, the positive impact of McDonald’s departure makes the world a better place. For example, since McDonald’s cut down the forest to build a cow farm, it can cause deforestation that is threatening the ecosystem and animal habitats. In addition, McDonald’s produces 2 million tons of packaging each year. This means that the retirement of McDonald’s could prevent habitat loss, deforestation, and even waste problems and have a huge, positive impact on the environment.\n    However, the change in McDonald's retirement causes would vary between different stakeholders, but overall, it would only have a mild, or little difference between people’s lives. Although McDonald’s disappearance might shock many people, after a short term, the other fast-food restaurants would replace McDonald’s, so fast-food lovers could adapt to the new environment. Furthermore, although 210,000 people could lose their job, it is still possible for them to change to another job, or have an opportunity to change into another job that they have an interest in. Therefore, McDonald’s disappearance could have little or no difference at all to some people, and withdraw from all the honorable accomplishments.\n    In conclusion, I think that the disappearance of McDonald’s can make the world a better place for environmental, and medical reasons although it could have negative effects in some communities, and that McDonald’s would not be forgotten by the joy and honorable achievements that they have achieved in the last few years."}

Keep your eyes up and to be able to assess where you want to go.\n2. Look where you want to go - Your hands on the steering wheel follow your eyes, so look where you want to go, not what you want to avoid or navigate.  For example. you should be looking at the exit of a turn as you enter the turn (or the apex if it's a wide turn)\n3. Slow in, fast out - Cornering can be particularly tricky, because we tend to turn in too fast and too early, which can set up for a slow exit.  Brake hard, take it slow, and wait to turn into a corner to best position you and the car to accelerate swiftly out of the turn."}

{"instruction": "How can I improve my sleep?", "input": "", "output": "There are a number of variables that can help you improve your sleep.  It is important to try different recommendations and see which ones will have the biggest impact for you.  Sleep is the foundation of our mental and physical health and performance in all endeavors. \n\n1) View sunlight by going outside within 30-60 minutes of waking. Do that again in the late afternoon, prior to sunset. If you wake up before the sun is out and you want to be awake, turn on artificial lights and then go outside once the sun rises.\nOn bright cloudless days: view morning and afternoon sun for 10 min; cloudy days: 20 min; very overcast days 30-60 min. If you live someplace with very minimal light, consider an artificial daytime simulator source.\nDon’t wear sunglasses for this practice if you safely can, but contact lenses and eyeglasses are fine.\nNo, you don’t have to look directly at the sun, and never look at ANY light so bright it is painful to view! That said, you can’t wear a brimmed hat, sunglasses and remain in the shade and expect to “wake up” your circadian clock.\n\n2) Wake up at the same time each day and go to sleep when you first start to feel sleepy. Pushing through the sleepy late evening feeling and going to sleep too late is one reason people wake at 3 am and can’t fall back asleep.\n\n3) Avoid caffeine within 8-10 hours of bedtime. \n\n4) Avoid viewing bright lights—especially bright overhead lights between 10 pm and 4 am. Here is a simple rule: only use as much artificial lighting as is necessary for you to remain and move about safely at night. Blue blockers can help a bit at night but still dim the lights. Viewing bright lights of all colors are a problem for your circadian system. Candlelight and moonlight are fine. \n\n5) Limit daytime naps to less than 90 min, or don’t nap at all. \n\n6) If you wake up in the middle of the night (which, by the way, is normal to do once or so each night) but you can’t fall back asleep, consider doing an NSDR protocol when you wake up. \n\n7) Keep the room you sleep in cool and dark and layer on blankets that you can remove.\nYour body needs to drop in temperature by 1-3 degrees to fall and stay asleep effectively. Body temperature increases are one reason you wake up. Thus, keep your room cool and remove blankets as needed. If it’s too hot you would have to use a cooling device and that’s harder than simply tossing off blankets if you get too warm.\n\n8) Drinking alcohol messes up your sleep. As do most sleep medications.\n\n9) Kids have changing sleep needs over time. Adjust accordingly.\nTeens might be night owls at 15 but become “morning people” as they age or need 6 hours a night in summer and 7-8 in winter. It will vary."}

{"instruction": "What is a quantum computer?", "input": "", "output": "A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena. At small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any modern \"classical\" computer. In particular, a large-scale quantum computer could break widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the art is still largely experimental and impractical.\n\nThe basic unit of information in quantum computing is the qubit, similar to the bit in traditional digital electronics. Unlike a classical bit, a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two \"basis\" states, which loosely means that it is in both states simultaneously. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently.\n\nPhysically engineering high-quality qubits has proven challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research that aims to develop scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Two of the most promising technologies are superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields).\n\nAny computational problem that can be solved by a classical computer can also be solved by a quantum computer. Conversely, any problem that can be solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a classical computer, at least in principle given enough time. In other words, quantum computers obey the Church–Turing thesis. This means that while quantum computers provide no additional advantages over classical computers in terms of computability, quantum algorithms for certain problems have significantly lower time complexities than corresponding known classical algorithms. Notably, quantum computers are believed to be able to solve certain problems quickly that no classical computer could solve in any feasible amount of time—a feat known as \"quantum supremacy.\" The study of the computational complexity of problems with respect to quantum computers is known as quantum complexity theory."}

The micro implications are very specific to the case(s) being brought and therefore won't be covered here. The key macro implication of indicting a former President is the risk that the criminal justice system becomes a tool to persecute political opponents (former, current OR potential) by whichever person or party is in power. There are several examples of this in other countries throughout history. That being said, there are just as many examples of countries indicting former presidents without any sign of abuse. In fact, it can be an important part of the \"checks and balances\" of a democracy (see France, South Korea, etc.) One of the factors you can look at when determining if the justice system is being abused or not is the number of cases/indictments being brought against the former head of government. When the number of cases is low, there is a higher likelihood of abuse. But when the number of cases is high and for a diverse number of reasons, the likelihood of abuse is lower."}

{"instruction": "Tell me about water fluoridation", "input": "", "output": "Water fluoridation is the controlled adjustment of fluoride to a public water supply solely to reduce tooth decay. Fluoridated water contains fluoride at a level that is effective for preventing cavities; this can occur naturally or by adding fluoride. Fluoridated water operates on tooth surfaces: in the mouth, it creates low levels of fluoride in saliva, which reduces the rate at which tooth enamel demineralizes and increases the rate at which it remineralizes in the early stages of cavities. Typically a fluoridated compound is added to drinking water, a process that in the U.S. costs an average of about $1.17 per person-year. Defluoridation is needed when the naturally occurring fluoride level exceeds recommended limits. In 2011, the World Health Organization suggested a level of fluoride from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/L (milligrams per litre), depending on climate, local environment, and other sources of fluoride. Bottled water typically has unknown fluoride levels.\n\nTooth decay remains a major public health concern in most industrialized countries, affecting 60–90% of schoolchildren and the vast majority of adults. Water fluoridation reduces cavities in children, while efficacy in adults is less clear. A Cochrane review estimates a reduction in cavities when water fluoridation was used by children who had no access to other sources of fluoride to be 35% in baby teeth and 26% in permanent teeth. However, this was based on older studies which failed to control for numerous variables, such as increasing sugar consumption as well as other dental strategies. Most European countries have experienced substantial declines in tooth decay, though milk and salt fluoridation is widespread in lieu of water fluoridation. Recent studies suggest that water fluoridation, particularly in industrialized nations, may be unnecessary because topical fluorides (such as in toothpaste) are widely used, and caries rates have become low.\n\nAlthough fluoridation can cause dental fluorosis, which can alter the appearance of developing teeth or enamel fluorosis, the differences are mild and usually not an aesthetic or public health concern. There is no clear evidence of other side effects from water fluoridation. Fluoride's effects depend on the total daily intake of fluoride from all sources. Drinking water is typically the largest source; other methods of fluoride therapy include fluoridation of toothpaste, salt, and milk. The views on the most efficient method for community prevention of tooth decay are mixed. The Australian government states that water fluoridation is the most effective way to achieve fluoride exposure that is community-wide. The World Health Organization reports that water fluoridation, when feasible and culturally acceptable, has substantial advantages, especially for subgroups at high risk, while the European Commission finds no benefit to water fluoridation compared with topical use.\n\nPublic water fluoridation was first practiced in the U.S. As of 2012, 25 countries have artificial water fluoridation to varying degrees, 11 of them have more than 50% of their population drinking fluoridated water. A further 28 countries have water that is naturally fluoridated, though in many of them the fluoride is above the optimal level. As of 2012, about 435 million people worldwide received water fluoridated at the recommended level (i.e., about 5.4% of the global population). 56  About 214 million of them live in the United States. Major health organizations such as the World Health Organization and FDI World Dental Federation supported water fluoridation as safe and effective. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists water fluoridation as one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th century in the U.S. Despite this, the practice is controversial as a public health measure. Some countries and communities have discontinued fluoridation, while others have expanded it. Opponents of the practice argue that neither the benefits nor the risks have been studied adequately, and debate the conflict between what might be considered mass medication and individual liberties."}

While you are assembling the sandwich, heat a shallow pan over medium-low heat on your stovetop.\n\nStep 4. Spread some mayonnaise on the inside of each slice of bread. Sprinkle some garlic powder over the mayonnaise -- this gives a little extra flavor that one might not expect from a grilled cheese. \n\nStep 5. Layer the cheese between the slices of bread. Don't put too much cheese on it, or it will leak out of the sandwich when you cut it!\n\nStep 6. Assemble the sandwich and put a thin layer of mayo on the outside of each slice. \n\nStep 7. Lay the sandwich inside your heated pan. It should sizzle immediately. Wait two minutes and check to see if the cheese is melting. If the bread is browning too quickly, turn the heat down. When it is adequately browned on one side, use a spatula to flip it over to grill the other side.\n\nStep 8. Once your sandwich is grilled to your liking, turn off the stove and remove your sandwich from the pan. Slice diagonally and serve with a bowl of hot tomato soup. Enjoy!"}

Dubbed the \"King of Pop\", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, as well as the robot.\nThe eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his public debut in 1964 with his older brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records. He became a solo star with his 1979 album Off the Wall. His music videos, including those for \"Beat It\", \"Billie Jean\", and \"Thriller\" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an artform and promotional tool. He helped propel the success of MTV and continued to innovate with videos for the albums Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995), and Invincible (2001). Thriller became the best-selling album of all time, while Bad was the first album to produce five US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles.\nFrom the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his changing appearance, relationships, behavior, and lifestyle. In 1993, he was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out of civil court; Jackson was not indicted due to lack of evidence. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. The FBI found no evidence of criminal conduct by Jackson in either case. In 2009, while he was preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, Jackson died from an overdose of propofol administered by his personal physician, Conrad Murray, who was convicted in 2011 of involuntary manslaughter. His death triggered reactions around the world, creating unprecedented surges of Internet traffic and a spike in sales of his music. A televised memorial service for Jackson, held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, was viewed by more than an estimated 2.5 billion people globally.\nJackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 400 million records worldwide.\n\nHe had 13 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles (third highest of any artist in the Hot 100 era) and was the first artist to have a top-ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades. His honors include 15 Grammy Awards, 6 Brit Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and 39 Guinness World Records, including the \"Most Successful Entertainer of All Time\". Jackson's inductions include the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (twice), the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Dance Hall of Fame (the only recording artist to be inducted), and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame."}

Java is the fifth most commonly used programming language according to Stack Overflow. Java is generally faster and more efficient than Python because it is a compiled language. While it's one of the coding languages considered to be easy to learn because many of the processes of this high-level language run automatically. However, Python still takes the cake in terms of simplicity. \n\n As an interpreted language, Python has simpler, more concise syntax than Java. It can perform the same function as Java in fewer lines of code. Python also offers extensive libraries, especially around data analysis and machine learning. Because it's dynamically typed, it allows for even fast development compared to Java. \n\nOther key differences include how each handles memory management and the ability to run multiple threads at the same time. \n\nFor example, lets dive into this threading difference. Java fully supports multithreading. When you use Java, you can run more than one thread at a time. When running multiple threads, they share a common memory area to increase efficiency and performance. Now if you search the web for threading in Python you might be a bit confused. You will find articles claiming that Python can't support multithreading but then you will also find tutorials and packages for threading and parallel processing. Python has a Global Interpreter Lock that only lets one thread execute at a time, so if you're working on a multi-threaded CPU-bound program, it'll likely be even slower. However, it's threading package allows you to speed up I/O bound programs. Using multiprocessing programs instead of multithreaded programs can be an effective workaround.\n\nThe answer to which is better is largely dependent on the user and the use case. Before learning one or starting a new project with either, think about what your goals are and decide which one fits those more closely."}
{"instruction": "What is the least common birthday?", "input": "", "output": "The least common birthday in the modern Gregorian calendar is February 29. This is because of leap years, as February 29 occurs only a bit more than a quarter of the time in any given calendar year.\n\nHowever excluding February 29, in most Western countries the least common birthday is December 25. For instance, in the United States between 1973 and 1999, September 16 is the most common birthday and December 25 the least common birthday. Some other uncommon birthdays in the West are January 1, December 24, and April 1.\n\nThe least common birthday is usually a holiday when most people take time off work. There are multiple reasons why these days have fewer births, but one reason is that doctors are less likely to schedule cesarean births on such days. April 1 is an exception, and is likely because parents who are able to choose not to give birth on that day, to prevent their children from being bullied for having their birthday on April Fool's Day.\n\nThis question is harder to answer in many non-Western countries as there is less easily accessible data. For example in a survey of students in India between 2007 and 2012, the statistics show much more births just before school opens, and on round days like the 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th. This indicates much of the data may be faked."}

The building was enlarged in the 1850s by extending the wings for the chambers for the bicameral legislature, the House of Representatives in the south wing and the Senate in the north wing. The massive dome was completed around 1866 just after the American Civil War.

{"instruction": "What is Asperger syndrome?", "input": "", "output": "Asperger syndrome (AS), or Asperger's, is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. The syndrome is no longer recognized as a diagnosis, having been merged with other conditions into autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It was considered to differ from other diagnoses that were incorporated into ASD by relatively unimpaired spoken language and intelligence.\n\nThe syndrome was named after the Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger, who, in 1944, described children in his care who struggled to form friendships, did not understand others’ gestures or feelings, engaged in one-sided conversations about their favorite interests, and were clumsy. In 1994, the diagnosis of Asperger's was included in the fourth edition (DSM-IV) of the American Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; however, with the publication of DSM-5 in 2013, the syndrome was removed, and the symptoms are now included within autism spectrum disorder along with classic autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). It was similarly merged into autism spectrum disorder in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as of 2021.\n\nThe exact cause of Asperger's is poorly understood. While it has high heritability, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying condition. There is no single treatment, and the UK's National Health Service (NHS) guidelines suggest that ’treatment’ of any form of autism should not be a goal since autism is not an 'a disease that can be removed or cured’. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, while co-occurring conditions might require treatment, ’management of autism itself is chiefly about providing the education, training and social support/care required to improve the person's ability to function in the everyday world’. Only limited data support the effectiveness of particular interventions for autism. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems, such as mood or anxiety. Autistic characteristics tend to become less evident in adulthood , but social and communication difficulties usually persist."}

The \"center\" of the culture was the settlement of Tiryns that saw further development during the Mycenean period.\n\nMetal and Terracotta: A unique pattern-painted dark to light human figurine appears in Tiryns culture's Lerna IV while old types of animal figurines do not continue. Metal is now more popular for the creation of weapons and tools, some examples are : A dagger, a nail, a pin from Lerna and three axes from Thebes.\n\nPottery: The best known type of pottery consists of two classes of pattern-painted ceramics: 1) Patterned ware that is a dark on light class, mainly in the Peloponnese. The ornament is geometric and almost exclusively rectilinear. 2) Ayia Marina ware that is a light on dark class, mainly in Central Greece. The ornament is similar to patterned ware. The dark paint on both wares is moderately lustrous and appears to be descended directly from the Urfirnis paint on Early Helladic II period.\n\nArchitecture: At Lerna and Olympia several \"long houses\" (megara) with two or three rooms and narrow alleyways are built. A tumulus is constructed over the ruins of the Helladic II House of the Tiles and for a long period no buildings are built in the specific area. Many large (for their period) buildings are constructed in Lerna but they often last for only one generation.\n\nEnd: In around 2,000 BC, Early Helladic III and generally the Early Helladic periods end.

Based on this abstract  would it be a good idea to enroll a child with ASD into group sports? \n\"Given the characteristics of people with Autism Spectrum Disorder, it is evident the difficulties they show in the development of social skills. The scarce participation of people with Autism Spectrum Disorder in group sports can be taken as a reference. The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of football on the development of social skills in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. In order to measure the sporting impact, it was necessary to implement a football training programme with the intention of evaluating different social skills. Thirteen children participated in the programme, all of them with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder and with a severity level of 1. The study was based on a pre-experimental, pre-test/post-test design. Non-parametric tests were used for the statistical analysis, applying the Wilcoxon test. Two specific tools on social skills were used for data collection. The results showed a generalised improvement in the dimensions linked to the social skills assessed. This highlights the possibility of considering group sport as an alternative to be taken into account to work on and enhance social skills in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder\"", "input": "", "output": "In this study, the authors assess 13 children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD-Level 1)  on their social skills, before and after being enrolled in a football training program. The authors claim that the results showed an overall improvement in participant's social skills. \nThis suggests that participating in group sports maybe considered as a method to improve children with ASD's social and communication skills."}

A list will make you more efficient once you get to the grocery store.  Organize your list by aisles.  An example of this is organizing your list by produce, meats, household supplies, snacks, and drinks.  This way you can go aisle-to-aisle skipping aisles that don't have what you are shopping for."}

You've probably seen the wagon wheel effect when watching a movie or tv show and the wheels of a car appear to be spinning backwards even as the car moves forwards. This is an effect of aliasing. This occurs because the sampling rate of the film is not adequate to capture the frequency of the signal (the frequency that the tires are spinning forwards) and the signal becomes indistinguishable from another signal (a frequency of the tires spinning backwards). As an example of how this happens imagine that the camera's sampling rate allows it to record an image frame at about 90% of the frequency that the tires are spinning. That is, the tire is spinning fast enough that it rotates 90% around in between each picture the camera can take. In this case, the wheel will look like its rotated backwards by 10% of a rotation on each image. When you put these images together in a film, the tires will appear to be rotating backwards."}

{"instruction": "What is the last step before a star collapses into a black hole?", "input": "", "output": "Stars that have a higher mass than about 2.2 solar masses (the mass of our Sun) will typically collapse into black holes at the end of their life cycle when fusion has stopped and no longer pushes out against the inward pull of gravity. For stars of this mass, their inward pull of gravity is too strong to be resisted by other forces, thus their fate is to become black holes. However, stars under this limit and above the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 solar masses will end their lifecycles as neutron stars. Neutron stars are also the remnants of dead stars but since they have a smaller mass, their gravity is not enough for them to cross into becoming black holes. As the dead star compresses and becomes more and more dense, regular matter is turned into neutrons and the last force to resist the pull of gravity is called degenerate neutron pressure, which is a quantum effect that dictates that no two neutrons may be in the same quantum state. This creates an outward pressure that resists the pull of gravity and settles the star into a neutron star. If more mass is added later, from a star companion or other sources, once the star's mass crosses the limit of around 2.2 solar masses even degenerate neutron pressure isn't enough to balance gravity and the star will collapse into a black hole."}

Although his work was published in the architectural press of his day, it was little appreciated outside Glasgow during his lifetime. It has only been since the 1950s and 1960s that his critical reputation has revived—not least of all in connection with his probable influence on Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nHenry-Russell Hitchcock wrote of Thomson in 1966: \"Glasgow in the last 150 years has had two of the greatest architects of the Western world. C. R. Mackintosh was not highly productive but his influence in central Europe was comparable to such American architects as Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright. An even greater and happily more productive architect, though one whose influence can only occasionally be traced in America in Milwaukee and in New York City and not at all as far as I know in Europe, was Alexander Thomson\"."}
{"instruction": "Vanessa and Lauren are both 32-year-old women with different levels of exercise experience. Vanessa, who weighs 124 lbs, has lifted weights before but Lauren, who weighs 166 lbs, has never participated in resistance training. Both women participate in initial fitness assessments and want your advice about starting a muscular fitness program at your exercise facility. Choose a different test to measure each woman's upper body muscular strength. Briefly explain the procedures for each assessment. What common errors should you watch for?", "input": "", "output": "For Vanessa, we’ll choose for her to perform a one-rep max assessment, specifically with the bench press. This is because she has experience with lifting weights. To start, she should warm up by completing several submaximal repetitions. We’re going to select an initial weight of 50-70% of her capacity, and progressively increase resistance by 2.5 to 20 kg until the subject cannot complete the repetitions. The final weight lifted should be the absolute 1-RM. Some common error we want to watch for is to make sure that the repetitions are performed at the same speed of movement and range of motion to ensure consistency. Additionally, on the setup portion, we should check the surroundings for hazards, set the bar to the right height for Vanessa based on her arm length, remove safety bars from both sides of the rack, secure weights correctly with safety clips, and have a spotter present. We should also make sure there is a proper progression of weight lifted, she’s not bouncing the bar off her chest, that she’s maintaining a neutral spine, and that she is breathing during the lift. For Lauren, because she has never participated in resistance training, we will select the flexed arm support test, as she may not be able to perform the dynamic push-up assessment properly. To start, she should have her hands outside her shoulders, and keep her back and legs straight. She should lower her body until the upper arm is parallel to the floor or the elbow is flexed at 90 degrees. She should be supporting her body in a push-up position from the knees. Some common mistakes include not breathing during the assessment, having a too-wide or too-narrow width for her hands, not maintaining a straight back and legs, and not lowering her body enough for the assessment."}

{"instruction": "What is the Monty Hall problem?", "input": "", "output": "The Monty Hall problem is a probability brain teaser that many consider to be counterintuitive. The problem is stated as follows: Imagine you are a contestant on a game show and the host shows you 3 doors. Behind one of the doors is a car and behind the other two are goats. The prizes have been randomly assigned to the doors and you want to win the car. The host allows you to pick one of the doors as a first selection. Then, the host opens one of the remaining doors and reveals a goat is behind it. The host now allows you to decide if you want to switch from your selected door to the remaining unopened door. Should you switch, to maximize your probability of winning the car?\n\nMost people believe switching does not improve your probability of winning the car. However switching does increase your probability of winning the car from 1/3 to 2/3. An intuitive way to understand this problem is by first considering the initial state. At your first selection the probability that you have selected the right door is 1/3 and the probability that the car remains behind one of the two unselected doors is 2/3. Then the host reveals more information. The host reveals that one of the unselected doors does not have the car behind it. The probability that the originally unselected doors must have the car behind one of them is still 2/3, but you now know one of them specifically which does not have the car. Therefore, the remaining unopened unselected door must have a probability of 2/3 to contain the car, and your originally selected door must have a probability of 1/3. When offered the chance, you should switch to maximize your chances of winning the car."}

Friendly competitions and matches organized between clubs are not included. The football associations FIFA and UEFA run international and European competitions; while The Football Association, and its mostly self-governing subsidiary bodies the English Football League and Premier League, run national competitions.\n\nThe European governing body UEFA was founded in 1954, and created their first and most prestigious competition, the European Cup, the next year. It was expanded and renamed in 1992 as the UEFA Champions League. Liverpool hold the English record, with six wins. Parallel to UEFA, various officials created the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1955, but this competition was disbanded when UEFA created the replacement tournament, UEFA Cup, in 1971 (renamed the UEFA Europa League in 2009) The English record number of Europa League wins is three, also held by Liverpool. Another competition absorbed into the UEFA Cup, in 1999, was the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, which was created in 1960 and featured the winners of national knockout competitions The winners of this competition played the European Cup winners in the UEFA Super Cup, starting in 1972 (recognised by UEFA in 1973), which now features the winners of the Champions League and Europa League.Liverpool also hold the English record, with four wins, in the UEFA Super Cup. The International Football Cup, also known as the UEFA Intertoto Cup, was a competition for clubs not participating in the European Cup, UEFA Cup or Cup Winners' Cup. The tournament commenced in 1961, but UEFA officially recognised it only in 1995, and discontinued in 2008, with the Europa League expanded to accommodate Intertoto Cup clubs. UEFA and CONMEBOL also created an intercontinental competition in 1960, the Intercontinental Cup, featuring continental champions from both associations. In 2000, the international governing body FIFA created the FIFA Club World Cup and in 2004 the Intercontinental Cup was merged into it. Manchester United are the only English club to have won the Intercontinental Cup, while United, Chelsea and Liverpool are the only English teams to have lifted the Club World Cup.\n\nEngland's first competition organised by a national body, the FA Cup, began in the 1871–72 season, making it one of the oldest football competitions in the world.Arsenal hold the record number of wins, with 14. League football began in the next decade with the founding of The Football League in 1888–89. The name First Division was adopted in 1892, when The Football League gained a second division. The First Division remained the highest division of the English league system until 1992, when the Premier League was founded. Manchester United have won the most top division titles, 20. The English equivalent of the super cup began in 1898 with the inauguration of the Sheriff of London Charity Shield, pitting the best professional and amateur sides of the year against each other. The trophy would develop into the FA Charity Shield in 1908, which was later renamed the FA Community Shield in 2002. Manchester United also hold the record here, with 21 wins. The Football League created its own knockout competition in 1960, the League Cup. Its current record is nine wins, held by Liverpool. The Anglo-Italian League Cup was created in 1969 to match English cup winners against the winners of the Coppa Italia, and was permanently disbanded in 1976. In 1985, the Full Members' Cup and Football League Super Cup were created as substitutes for UEFA competitions after UEFA responded to the Heysel Stadium disaster by banning English clubs. They finished in 1992 and 1986, respectively. The Football League Centenary Trophy marked The Football League's 100th birthday, in the 1988–89 season \n\nLower down in the hierarchy of English football are many other competitions, not included in the tables on this page. These include competitions run by the above national governing bodies, but organised for clubs ineligible for higher competitions. For example, the Texaco Cup and EFL Trophy. Regional competitions are organised by County Football Associations. In the years when league football was unavailable or only available to northern and midlands clubs, the county competitions coexisted with the FA Cup as the main tournaments for clubs. Nowadays, county cups are contested by lower or regional division teams and those that still participate generally field youth or reserve sides."}

{"instruction": "How are clouds formed?", "input": "", "output": "It all begins with aerosols. Aerosols are tiny airborne particles typically from natural sources such as dust from soil or volcanic ash, sea salt, etc or artificial sources such as carbon from fossil fuels. These aerosols are light enough to be airborne for long periods of time or only a few hours. These serve as condensation nuclei for evaporated water that rises and cools. These aerosols act as a magnet for the vapor and allow it to condense around it and thus form water droplets. A large amount of these water droplets is what makes up a cloud."}

{"instruction": "How to get an efficient cardio workout and improve your speed, and gain other health benefits?", "input": "", "output": "In this day and age when many are busy with work, family, electronic gadgets, social media it becomes increasingly challenging to find the time to exercise.  Staying healthy will allow you to enjoy those distractions longer, but jokes aside it will make you feel energized, motivated and bring out the best in you.  When new discoveries in scenic areas are correctly applied, you don’t need to spend multiple hours at the gym, you don’t have to starve to achieve your goals, this concept was very enticing to me when I first learnt about the Sprint 8 program at my local gym.  I decided to give this a try!\n\nSprint 8 - Its a 20 minute routine, where you spend the first 30 seconds working out at the highest level of intensity (go all out) followed by 90 seconds of active recovery, repeat this 8 times..  You can use a bike, treadmill, elliptical whichever suits your style.  In all my life of being fairly active, Sprint 8 has the toughest workout, but over a year I could see significant results.  I was able to run faster, lower blood pressure, reduce fat percentage, and improve muscle mass.  The key differentiator about this program is that it engages all the three muscle fiber types and releases exercise induced growth hormones to help your body become stronger, leaner and healthier.\n\nAnother advantage is that this program really reduces any change of injury that one may face by running, heavy weight lifting etc therefore allowing you to sustain the exercise program for years to come.  \n\nGive this a try and gain the benefits of efficient exercising."}

{"instruction": "Is UBS a good bank", "input": "", "output": "UBS Group AG is a multinational investment bank and financial services company founded and based in Switzerland. Co-headquartered in the cities of Zürich and Basel, it maintains a presence in all major financial centres as the largest Swiss banking institution and the largest private bank in the world. UBS client services are known for their strict bank–client confidentiality and culture of banking secrecy. Because of the bank's large positions in the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific markets, the Financial Stability Board considers it a global systemically important bank.\n\nApart from private banking, UBS provides wealth management, asset management, and investment banking services for private, corporate, and institutional clients with international service. UBS manages the largest amount of private wealth in the world, counting approximately half of the world's billionaires among its clients. Despite its trimming of sell-side operations, UBS maintains a global investment bank and is considered a primary market maker. The bank also maintains numerous underground bank vaults, bunkers, and storage facilities for gold bars around the Swiss Alps and internationally. Partly due to its banking secrecy, it has been at the centre of numerous tax avoidance investigations undertaken by U.S., French, German, Israeli, and Belgian authorities. UBS operations in Switzerland and the United States were respectively ranked first and second on the 2018 Financial Secrecy Index.\n\nAs of May 2022, UBS is the third largest bank in Europe with a market capitalization of $63 billion. It is one of the eight global \"Bulge Bracket\" banks. It has over CHF 3.2 trillion in assets under management (AUM), approximately CHF 2.8 trillion of which are invested assets. In June 2017, its return on invested capital was 11.1%, followed by Goldman Sachs' 9.35%, and JPMorgan Chase's 9.456%. In late 2016, UBS established a blockchain technology research lab in London to advance its cyber security and encryption of client activities. Based on regional deal flow and political influence, UBS is considered one of the \"biggest, most powerful financial institutions in the world\". The company's capital strength, security protocols, and reputation for discretion have yielded a substantial market share in banking and a high level of brand loyalty. Alternatively, it receives routine criticism for facilitating tax noncompliance and off-shore financing. UBS is a primary dealer and Forex counterparty of the U.S. Federal Reserve."}

{"instruction": "Who was Rosa Parks?", "input": "", "output": "Rosa Louise McCauley Parks, born on February 4, 1913 was an American activist in the civil rights movement best known for her pivotal role in the Montgomery bus boycott. The United States Congress has honored her as \"the first lady of civil rights\" and \"the mother of the freedom movement\". Parks became a NAACP activist in 1943, participating in several high profile civil rights campaigns. On December 1, 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama, Parks rejected bus driver James F. Blake's order to vacate a row of four seats in the \"colored\" section in favor of a White passenger, once the \"White\" section was filled. Parks was not the first person to resist bus segregation, but the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) believed that she was the best candidate for seeing through a court challenge after her arrest for civil disobedience in violating Alabama segregation laws, and she helped inspire the Black community to boycott the Montgomery buses for over a year. The case became bogged down in the state courts, but the federal Montgomery bus lawsuit Browder v. Gayle resulted in a November 1956 decision that bus segregation is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nParks's act of defiance and the Montgomery bus boycott became important symbols of the movement. She became an international icon of resistance to racial segregation, and organized and collaborated with civil rights leaders, including Edgar Nixon and Martin Luther King Jr. At the time, Parks was employed as a seamstress at a local department store and was secretary of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP. She had recently attended the Highlander Folk School, a Tennessee center for training activists for workers' rights and racial equality. Although widely honored in later years, she also suffered for her act; she was fired from her job, and received death threats for years afterwards. Shortly after the boycott, she moved to Detroit, where she briefly found similar work. From 1965 to 1988, she served as secretary and receptionist to John Conyers, an African-American US Representative. She was also active in the Black Power movement and the support of political prisoners in the US.\n\nAfter retirement, Parks wrote her autobiography and continued to insist that there was more work to be done in the struggle for justice. Parks received national recognition, including the NAACP's 1979 Spingarn Medal, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal, and a posthumous statue in the United States Capitol's National Statuary Hall. Upon her death in 2005, she was the first woman to lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda. California and Missouri commemorate Rosa Parks Day on her birthday, February 4, while Ohio, Oregon, and Texas commemorate the anniversary of her arrest, December 1."}

The theory describes gravity not as a force, but as the curvature of spacetime, caused by the uneven distribution of mass, and causing masses to move along geodesic lines.\nHowever, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes gravity as a force causing any two bodies to be attracted toward each other, with magnitude proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them."}

Here are some steps to follow to help you get out of a maze:\n\nStay Calm and Focused: Getting lost in a maze can be frustrating, but it's important to stay calm and focused. Take deep breaths, relax, and clear your mind. This will help you to think more clearly and make better decisions.\n\nPlan Your Route: Take a few minutes to look at the maze from above, if possible, and try to identify the route to the exit. Identify landmarks or walls that you can use as reference points. Look for any dead ends, and try to avoid them.\n\nFollow One Wall: If you can't identify the exit route, try to follow one wall of the maze. Keep your hand on the wall and follow it all the way around the maze. This will help you to stay on track and avoid getting lost in circles.\n\nMark Your Path: If you have something to mark your path, such as chalk, breadcrumbs, or a pen, use it to mark your route as you go. This way, you can avoid taking the same path multiple times and can backtrack if necessary.\n\nLook for Clues: Keep an eye out for clues that may help you find your way out, such as arrows or signs. Many mazes also have hidden clues or puzzles that can help you find the exit, so keep your eyes open.\n\nAsk for Help: If you're still struggling to find your way out, don't be afraid to ask for help. Many mazes have staff members who can guide you out or provide you with clues.\n\nWith these tips in mind, you should be able to find your way out of a maze. Remember to stay calm, plan your route, and look for clues, and you'll be out in no time!"}

{"instruction": "What is the recipe for a successful hackathon?", "input": "", "output": "LabCorp had its second annual “Innovation Days” (or hackathon) event in February, 2020. The event was a success, and this post describes the secret ingredient that helped make it a success: Lipton® Onion Soup Mix. The soup mix captures the essence of a successful hackathon… some functional, and some personal to the LabCorp leadership.\n\nThe first reason that the soup mix embodies the spirit of the hackathon is simple: the product is rarely used as it was intended: to make soup. In fact, the soup mix launched into culinary notoriety in the early 1950s for its role in a non-soup recipe: potato chip dip. Referred to as “California Dip” originally, this recipe takes bland sour cream and gives it a flavorful zing and distinctive texture. For over half a century, this soup mix has been a party favorite thanks to people hacking a recipe and using materials in an unexpected manner. The benefit of the soup mix as a dip enhancer is that it helps speed up the process of making a consistently flavorful dip. For people participating in a hackathon, this is something to look for: can hackathon ideas or aspects of the hackathon projects be applied to existing processes to help streamline them?\n\nThe journey of “inventing” the soup mix also captures the essence of the hackathon. The engineer who helped create this soup mix had failed years earlier. He was not trying to make soup during the Second World War, he was trying to save lives. So he invented a - sadly ineffective - method for freeze-drying blood that could be reconstituted on the battlefield to save lives. His vision for “dried blood” being used on the battlefield was not viable. Let’s hope it did not require too many “QA” folks to realize this product was DOA. Years later, however, it was the method of freeze-drying that was in his mind when he helped design Lipton® Onion Soup Mix.\n\nLabCorp CIO, Lance Berberian told the origin story of Lipton® Onion Soup Mix as the keynote speaker during the Innovation Days event. Mr. Berberian recounted the story from his uncle, and, like many stories told by uncles, we hope it to be true. The take-away message, as it relates to hackathons: remember your failed attempts. Aspects of your failed attempts may be core to your future successes.\n\nMr. Berberian was very engaged in the hackathon. In fact, his leadership team was front-and-center on launch day as well as on presentation day. The story about his uncle was powerful because it set the tone for the event: experiment, learn, network, and expect the unexpected. And the unexpected did happen during the event. Near the end of presentation day, a participant in the audience suddenly collapsed and began seizing. Many folks rushed to help and call 911. As a compassionate leader, Mr. Berberian was on the front-lines of the incident, and he stayed with the sick colleague while we waited for an ambulance to arrive. This, I believe, captures the true secret ingredient of a successful hackathon: engaged leadership."}

{"instruction": "What is CRISPR?", "input": "", "output": "CRISPR  (an acronym for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) is a family of DNA sequences found in the genomes of prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria and archaea. These sequences are derived from DNA fragments of bacteriophages that had previously infected the prokaryote. They are used to detect and destroy DNA from similar bacteriophages during subsequent infections. Hence these sequences play a key role in the antiviral (i.e. anti-phage) defense system of prokaryotes and provide a form of acquired immunity. CRISPR is found in approximately 50% of sequenced bacterial genomes and nearly 90% of sequenced archaea.\n\nCas9 (or \"CRISPR-associated protein 9\") is an enzyme that uses CRISPR sequences as a guide to recognize and cleave specific strands of DNA that are complementary to the CRISPR sequence. Cas9 enzymes together with CRISPR sequences form the basis of a technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 that can be used to edit genes within organisms. This editing process has a wide variety of applications including basic biological research, development of biotechnological products, and treatment of diseases. The development of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technique was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020 which was awarded to Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna.\n\nIn 2022, in a proceeding at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (interference 106,115), the Patent Trial and Appeal Board decided that the inventor for the US patent covering application of CRISPR-Cas9 in eukaryotic cells is Feng Zhang, a professor of the Broad Institute."}

The creamy texture can help mimic the egg’s soft texture in your breakfast meals and desserts.\nUnsweetened applesauce - You can use a quarter cup of unsweetened applesauce for one egg. It adds moisture and sweetness to what you are making. The natural fruit pectin also helps bind the ingredients. It can be dense than an egg in your baking so you may need to use a teaspoon of baking powder to encourage fluffiness. \nMashed banana - This has a very distinct flavor, so only use it in recipes when you think the banana flavor will complement what you are making. This works well in pancakes, brownies, and banana bread. You can use a ripe medium mashed banana for every large egg. The starches and sugars in the banana help develop a beautiful golden brown crust. \nAquafaba - This is an ideal substitute for egg whites, giving your dessert structure. Take three tablespoons of liquid from inside your can of chickpeas and whip them to a fluffy consistency. \nFlaxseeds or Chia Seeds - This is best for recipes that don’t require too many eggs. Combine one tablespoon of seeds with three tablespoons of water for every large egg. Let it sit for 20 minutes to get a slimy mixture that mimics and egg.\nBaking Soda and Vinegar - Mix a teaspoon of baking soda and a tablespoon of white vinegar together to help create the air bubbles needed in things like pancakes, cookies, and quick breads. This is ideal where two or less eggs are needed."}

A common view is that the U.S. won the Cold War because its capitalist economic system, characterized by free markets and the recognition of private property rights, was able to outperform the USSR's centrally-planned economy. The United States could therefore afford to spend more on its military than the USSR and won the nuclear arms race, which contributed to the internal collapse of the Soviet economy and the subsequent breakup of the Soviet Union into smaller, individual states with democratic elections. Additionally, though the USSR and the United States never officially engaged in direct military conflict with one another during the Cold War, various factions supported by the United States and its Western allies were able to successfully defeat Soviet-backed factions in proxy wars that took place all across the globe (with the notable exception of Vietnam). These defeats gradually limited the USSR's ability to project its power on the world stage, and helped the United States build and strengthen key alliances, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Finally, the United States carried out effective intelligence, counter-intelligence, disinformation and propaganda campaigns that undermined the faith the USSR's population had in its government and buttressed support for the U.S. government's efforts domestically. By 1991, the Soviet Union had fallen and the U.S. had achieved global hegemony."}

Rainbow is an example of physical optical illusion caused by refraction.   \n\nPhysiological optical illusion occurs when a pattern repeats over and over again and it is too much information for the brain. This causes the brain to think the images are moving. Kinetoscope uses images to create a video using physiological optical illusion. Flip books are another example of physiological optical illusion. \n\nCognitive optical illusion occurs when multiple people view the same image but they interpret it differently.

Look for the edges that match the center color and put them in their respective places on the first layer. This layer will be completed when you have all four matching edge pieces in place.\n\nBuild the second layer: Once the first layer is complete, turn the cube over and find the middle row. Look for the edge pieces that belong on this layer, and move them into place with an algorithm. The goal is to build a complete layer with the same color as the center.\n\nBuild the final layer: The final layer can be tricky, but with practice, it becomes easier. First, align the corners of the final layer with the corresponding edges. Then, apply an algorithm to move the corners to their correct positions. Once the corners are in place, use another algorithm to position the edges.\n\nFinish the cube: After completing the final layer, you may have some misaligned pieces. Don't worry, as a simple algorithm can fix them. Keep using the algorithm until all the sides of the cube are in place.\n\nWith practice, solving a Rubik's Cube can be achieved in under a minute. It's important to remember that it's all about pattern recognition and memorizing algorithms, so keep practicing and soon you'll be able to solve it without even thinking!"}

If you could only accomplish one of them, which would it be? Continue to identify the next most important goal until you have fully prioritized your list of goals.\n\nThe next step is to determine how much time you have to dedicate to each topic in order to ensure you can accomplish your goals fully. \n\nFinally, identify how many breaks you will need to build into your meeting time to ensure team members do not become too mentally taxed. One best practice is to take a 15-30 minute break every 90 minutes, and to take a one hour break every 4 hours.\n\nOnce you have identified all of these parameters, you can build your leadership meeting agenda."}

{"instruction": "What are some of the most accessible jazz albums for someone new to jazz?", "input": "", "output": "Jazz music encompasses a wide range of styles, genres and periods, so it can be difficult and confusing for the non-jazz listener to find a satisfying entry point. There have been many “greatest of all time” jazz album lists developed by jazz publications and critics over the years. The following is a brief sampling of some of the top-rated albums from some of these lists.\n- Miles Davis: Kind of Blue (1959) Miles Davis’ masterpiece. One of the most influential albums of all time, because of its widespread influence on jazz, rock and classical genres. It is the greatest selling jazz album of all time, and usually the number one pick on critics’ albums rankings. It features a cool, atmospheric modal approach that is immediately recognizable, tuneful and approachable for just about any listener.\n- John Coltrane: A Love Supreme (1964). Widely regarded as John Coltrane’s masterpiece, it is an intense modal jazz through-composed spiritual meditation in four parts. Every critic interprets John Coltrane’s intent and meaning of A Love Supreme differently. Whether you think he’s searching for some form of soulful purity, or cutting out the middle man to speak directly to God, your jazz-listening life won’t be the same after hearing this searing testament.\n- Sonny Rollins: Saxophone Collosus (1957). Sonny Rollins’ breakthrough and best-known album. Rollins emerges here as a true jazz giant belonging in the same pantheon as Coltrane, Ben Webster, Coleman Hawkins and Lester Young. His strong and highly rhythmic thematic improvisational voice is on brilliant display in ‘St. Thomas’ and ‘Blue 7’. Not to be missed is his powerful rendition of the jazz standard ‘You Don’t Know Love’ and his lovely solo during Kurt Weil’s ‘Moritat’ (also known as ‘Mack the Knife’).\n- Dave Brubeck: Time Out (1959) Featuring uncommon time signatures and mix of Cool and West Coast jazz, Time Out was the first jazz album to sell over a million copies and produced a single, ‘Take Five’ that became the first jazz single to sell over a million copies. Brubeck described his saxophone player Paul Desmond’s sound as “like a dry martini”. You’ll want to ice up a glass and pour yourself another with each listen to this enduring jazz mainstay.\n- John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman: John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman (1963) is a reluctant jazz ballad summit of giants. Johnny Hartman initially resisted the idea of recording an album with John Coltrane, believing they wouldn’t complement one another musically. Following an after-hours session with Coltrane and pianist McCoy Tyner, they agreed to work together and went in to the studio to record their self-title album that contained the definitive versions of ‘Lush Life’, ‘They Say It’s Wonderful’, and ‘My One and Only Love.’ This is an absolute essential album.\n- Billie Holiday: Lady in Satin (1958) Holiday’s album of Great American Songbook standards  - lushly arranged around her abused, fragile, but powerfully rhythmic voice - is a testament to her professional powers of persuasion and artistic willpower in what turned out to be the last year of a 44-yr life. She told her producers she wanted “a pretty album, something delicate.” They paid her $150 a side, in advance. Well, she gave them their money’s worth…and then some. Essential."}

The Statute of Limitations is a common example of laches where a plaintiff is precluded from bringing an action due to inordinate delay.\n\nA defense of waiver claims that the plaintiff knowingly and intentionally signed away, relinquished or otherwise abandoned the right which it claims was violated by the defendant. A common example of a waiver is when one engages in a dangerous act for pleasure such as sky diving or rock climbing. The instructor or facility would have the purchaser sign a waiver for bodily harm suffered from engaging in the dangerous act.\n\nBoth defenses are affirmative defenses and must be raised for them to take effect. It is important to note that affirmative defenses can themselves fall to laches and waiver."}

In this example someone who says they believe aliens do exist, believes they are speaking the truth but that does not make it a fact."}

In May 1993 he became the first Venezuelan president to be forced out of office by the Supreme Court on charges for the embezzlement of 250 million bolívars (roughly 2.7 million US dollars) belonging to a presidential discretionary fund, whose money was used to support the electoral process in Nicaragua and hire bodyguards for President Violeta Chamorro."}

{"instruction": "What are the top 3 TV shows you have binge watched and why?", "input": "", "output": "Hands down, my favorite series was The Americans. As someone who grew up in the 1980's, I could identify with the clothing and hair styles, the decor, and the dearth of real-time communication options (no internet, no email, no mobile phones, etc.). The limited communication modes is what led to secret information drop locations in this era, which were a common insurance in the show. But more importantly, I remember the feeling of growing up in the time of the Cold War. We were still having scheduled air raid drills in my grammar school as often as we'd have fire drills! As children, we were convinced that nuclear war was going to happen someday, even if the adults tried to tell us that it wasn't. Growing up about 25 miles from New York City, I was pretty sure that I'd be gone within seconds of a nuclear strike to the city. My next favorite has been Yellowstone. This is a show that seems to appeal to almost everyone because it has plenty of beautiful Western scenes (Montana), family drama, and battles between flawed characters.  This series is still ongoing and I can't wait for the next set of episodes to be released! I'd have to say my third favorite is Billions. It's a series from several years ago that we just happened upon. We are in season 2 of 5 or 6 total seasons, and I am riveted by the characters, especially Bobby Axelrod (Ax), and Chuck and Wendy Rhoades. They are all so intense and engrossed in what they do, so it makes for very interesting interactions and plot twists! And I have to give an Honorable Mention to Perry Mason. While this is a very new series, I absolutely love this period drama so far. The creators have based many of the episodes on similar actual events from this period (the 1930s). It is very difficult to watch Della Street, who is insanely smart and charming, be relegated to the 'brains behind the guy' (Perry Mason) because it's the 1930s. Thanks for reading! I enjoyed brainstorming my favorites and sharing them."}

An ROTC scholarship can help pay for most of your college degree, and you will have the option to join an active or reserve unit after college is complete.  You will likely owe about 4 years of service as an officer in return for the scholarship.  Another option is to go to a military academy.  Military academies provide full tuition in exchange for 5 years of service as an officer after graduation.  Finally, you could enlist in the military, serve 3-4 years as an enlisted soldier, and then use the G.I. Bill to attend college afterward.  The best choice for you depends on your college preferences, your financial situation, and the timeline on which you want to earn your college degree."}

If a party were allowed to unilaterally change the term of a contract, there may be no value in having a contract in the first place as an obvious change would be to change what a party has promised in the contract to little or nothing at all. This would erode any value of having a contract in the first place. However, there are contracts that allow a party to unilaterally change certain terms of the contract but they should not take away the substantial benefit of the contract from the other party or parties. If a party has agreed to allow the other to vary any of the terms of the contract, this is not ideal and the implications would depend on the extent and nature of the variations made. It is therefore prudent for both parties to avoid provisions to allow unilateral changes to the contract or at the very least, expressly limit the scope of unilateral changes."}

{"instruction": "Why are there so many different types of cheeses in France?", "input": "", "output": "Cheese production has a long history in France. It is believed that cheese was first introduced into France during Roman times. After the fall of the Roman empire, monasteries continued the production of cheese. Experimentation within the monasteries, regional isolation and differences in climate and vegetation across France lead to the creation of regional varieties of cheese (some of which still exist today). From about the 13th century onwards, cheese production started to develop on French farms. Over time, the recipes for making cheese were handed down from generation to generation (and tweaked and improved by each generation), further increasing the number of varieties. \n\nAs a result, today it is commonly considered that there are between 350 and 400 different types of French cheese – although there are actually almost 1,000 varieties! These cheeses are made from cows, sheep, goats or buffalo milk.\n\nCharles de Gaulle, a famous French president, once asked - \"How can you govern a country which has 246 varieties of cheese?\" It would be interesting to hear what his thoughts would be today now that there are almost 1000 different varieties."}

She has worked at this specific cafe for over 5 years and has learned to love the job, and has grown close to her coworkers and regular customers. While Mary is a specialist in preparing many types of coffee and tea drinks, her favorite of all time was to make the latte. One morning around 8:00 am, a regular customer named Eric came into the cafe. Eric usually orders a latte every morning around the same time and Mary really enjoys preparing his drink. When Mary saw Eric walk in, she started preparing his drink without even asking what he would order. First Mary greeted Eric and engaged in some small talk, conversing about the seasonally warm weather we were having. While simultaneously having this conversation, Mary was in process of making the coffee drink. Mary first ground 18g of espresso roast coffee on a fine grind setting. Once the coffee was ground, she filled the portafilter with the ground coffee. Once the portafilter was full of coffee, Mary tamped the coffee with a tamper, using about 30 pounds of force. When the portafilter was ready, she fixed it upon the espresso machine. Next Mary filled a milk pitcher with 12 ounces of whole milk. She then took the pitcher, held it to the steam wand, and started steaming the milk. For the first 5 seconds, she held the milk just below the surface of the milk to aerate the milk, and then moved the pitcher up so the steam wand was fully emerged. While the milk was steaming, Mary pressed the espresso button on the machine to start the pouring of the espresso into the two shot glasses. Mary was an expert in doing multiple latte making tasks simultaneously. As the milk finished steaming, she removed the pitcher, wiped down the steam wand, and set the milk aside. At that time, the espresso shots were done, and Mary poured the espresso from the shot glasses into the 16 oz paper cup. She then took the steamed milk and poured it over the espresso shots in the cup. She poured the milk in a specific way that would create latte art, this time she made a little heart out of the milk and foam. Once all the milk was poured, she put a cup on the coffee and handed the coffee over to Eric, who she was still having a conversation with. Once he received the coffee, Eric scanned his gift card on the computer which Mary had prepared for payment for the latte. After Eric was done paying, he took a sip of the drink and complimented Mary for another excellently prepared latte. After taking his sip, Eric then left the store, and got into this car, and drove away. It was moments like this every morning that reminded Mary why she loves this job so much, and looked forward to helping more customers for the remainder of her shift that morning."}

I think the most important thing about being a parent to a three year old is loving them, but the tricky part is how you let that love manifest. Kids are super sensitive and still learning emotions at this age, so its really important to be slow, intentional and extra super patient with a three year old. \n\nAn example I have of this from my little girl, Addie, who just turned three on Sunday, is communicating what is possible vs. what is not possible in a very clear way. Last night, I told my daughter that we had a doctor's appointment in the AM for her annual check-up, but she immediately wanted to go THEN, right away to the doctor. There began the two hour downhill spin into a full tantrum because she did not understand that she could not go to the doctor that night, because they were closed.\n\nThis might seem like a disparate example of how to show you love a child, but it took every ounce of my patience, calm and rationality to keep explaining to my screaming, flailing, alligator of a child that we could not see the doctor until tomorrow. (Also, what three year old is THAT excited to see a doctor?  I don't know, its insane to me!)\n\nSo the answer is, love, but in all ways that you can manifest that love, directly and indirectly."}

{"instruction": "What is glass made of", "input": "", "output": "Glass has become so commonplace today that it’s easy to see right through it without a second thought. It’s in our windows, on our screens, in our cabinets, and in many of the devices we interact with every day. Even though glass can be found everywhere, you may live your whole life not knowing much about how it’s made or what it’s composed of. Even if you think you know the basics, you’ve only skimmed the surface.   \n\nAt a high level, glass is sand that’s been melted down and chemically transformed. If you’ve ever been to the beach, you know exactly how hot sand can get while remaining in its solid form. The kind of heat necessary to transform sand into a liquid state (eventually becoming glass) is much hotter than any sunny day. To make sand melt, you need to heat it to roughly 1700°C (3090°F), which is approximately the same temperature a space shuttle reaches as it re-enters earth’s atmosphere.\n\nThe sand commonly used to make glass is comprised of small grains of quartz crystals, made up of molecules of silicon dioxide, which is also known as silica. When those molecules are heated to high enough temperatures, the sand melts and loses its crystalline structure, and as it cools it gains an entirely different structure. That structure, on a molecular level, is somewhere in between a liquid and a solid. This in-between state is known as an amorphous solid, which means it has some of the crystalline structure of a solid coupled with the molecular randomness of a liquid.\n\nGlass Melting\nDepending on the sand mixture, glass can have a variety of properties. Certain elements or chemicals mixed with sand can change glass’s color, for example. Glass’s properties can also change based on how it’s manufactured and the processes by which it’s shaped afterward. To strengthen glass, manufacturers can use thermal tempering to heat and cool it rapidly. Glass can also be strengthened chemically through an ion exchange process that makes the surface of the glass tougher.\n\nThe glass most people are familiar with is soda-lime glass, which is a combination of soda (also known as soda ash or washing soda), limestone, and sand. Although you can make glass simply by heating and then rapidly cooling silica, the manufacturing of soda-lime glass is a little more complex. By adding soda (sodium carbonate), the melting point of the sand is reduced so it can be transformed into glass at lower temperatures and save energy during manufacturing. However, adding soda to the mixture reduces its chemical durability, making it prone to dissolve when in contact with liquids. For most applications, that’s not desirable, so limestone (calcium carbonate) is also added to the mixture, which acts as a stabilizer. Once the mixture of silica, soda, and limestone is heated, it can be cooled and molded for a variety of applications. \nAt Corning, we know glass. We know how to strengthen it through chemical processes like ion exchange, and we know how to bend it to make optical fiber that can stretch over vast distances. Our knowledge of glass goes back more than a century, allowing us to remain on the cutting edge of research and development. From simple soda-lime to complex glass structures that enable augmented reality, glass is an adaptable, wide-ranging material. That’s why, after more than 165 years, we’re still making new discoveries."}
{"instruction": "What is The Silmarillion?", "input": "", "output": "The Silmarillion (Quenya: [silmaˈrilliɔn]) is a collection of myths[T 1] and stories in varying styles by the English writer J. R. R. Tolkien. It was edited and published posthumously by his son Christopher Tolkien in 1977, assisted by the fantasy author Guy Gavriel Kay.[T 2] It tells of Eä, a fictional universe that includes the Blessed Realm of Valinor, the once-great region of Beleriand, the sunken island of Númenor, and the continent of Middle-earth, where Tolkien's most popular works—The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings—are set. After the success of The Hobbit, Tolkien's publisher Stanley Unwin requested a sequel, and Tolkien offered a draft of the writings that would later become The Silmarillion. Unwin rejected this proposal, calling the draft obscure and \"too Celtic\", so Tolkien began working on a new story that eventually became The Lord of the Rings.\n\nThe Silmarillion has five parts. The first, Ainulindalë, tells in mythic style of the creation of Eä, the \"world that is.\" The second part, Valaquenta, gives a description of the Valar and Maiar, supernatural powers of Eä. The next section, Quenta Silmarillion, which forms the bulk of the collection, chronicles the history of the events before and during the First Age, including the wars over three jewels, the Silmarils, that gave the book its title. The fourth part, Akallabêth, relates the history of the Downfall of Númenor and its people, which takes place in the Second Age. The final part, Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age, is a brief summary of the events of The Lord of the Rings and those that led to them.\n\nThe book shows the influence of many sources, including the Finnish epic Kalevala, Greek mythology in the lost island of Atlantis (as Númenor) and the Olympian gods (in the shape of the Valar, though these also resemble the Norse Æsir).\n\nBecause J. R. R. Tolkien died leaving his legendarium unedited, Christopher Tolkien selected and edited materials to tell the story from start to end. In a few cases, this meant that he had to devise completely new material, within the tenor of his father's thought, to resolve gaps and inconsistencies in the narrative, particularly Chapter 22, \"Of the Ruin of Doriath\".\n\nThe Silmarillion received a generally poor reception on publication. Scholars found the work problematic, not least because the book is a construction, not authorised by Tolkien himself, from the large corpus of documents and drafts also called \"The Silmarillion\".

In a perfect world, we would be reunited with our loved ones, both human and pet, where we would no longer be in pain and can run free with those we care about most.  Alternatively, the more literal answer to this question would be that the physical body either goes into a coffin or some type of container or it is cremated into ashes after death."}

The slap shot, on the other hand, is accomplished with a wind-up involving lifting the hockey stick to shoulder height or higher and then slapping the ice slightly behind the puck, using the weight to bend the stick, storing energy in it like a spring. The player then rolls their wrists and shifts their weight so that the energy stored in the stick is released through the puck."}

An advantage of stock options compared to RSUs is that the gain between the strike price and the selling price is generally treated as a long-term capital gain, whereas the grant price of an RSU is treated as income, which is generally taxed at a higher rate. On the other hand, an advantage of RSUs is that they always have a nonzero value, whereas a stock option can become worthless if the stock price declines below the strike price."}

This method is opposite of competing fast food restaurants who assign the burger cooking to entry level employees and customer management to higher levels.  In-n-out maintains a smaller menu focusing on a few key items instead of an expansive or seasonally themed menu making it easier to maintain high standards of quality.  Lastly their slow growth and enthusiastic fans provide a positive atmosphere lending itself to people thinking more highly of In-n-out where without this influence might be neutral on the brand."}

{"instruction": "What is connectomics?", "input": "", "output": "Connectomics is the production and study of connectomes: comprehensive maps of connections within an organism's nervous system. More generally, it can be thought of as the study of neuronal wiring diagrams with a focus on how structural connectivity, individual synapses, cellular morphology, and cellular ultrastructure contribute to the make up of a network. The nervous system is a network made of billions of connections and these connections are responsible for our thoughts, emotions, actions, memories, function and dysfunction. Therefore, the study of connectomics aims to advance our understanding of mental health and cognition by understanding how cells in the nervous system are connected and communicate. Because these structures are extremely complex, methods within this field use a high-throughput application of functional and structural neural imaging, most commonly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electron microscopy, and histological techniques in order to increase the speed, efficiency, and resolution of these nervous system maps. To date, tens of large scale datasets have been collected spanning the nervous system including the various areas of cortex, cerebellum, the retina, the peripheral nervous system and neuromuscular junctions.\n\nGenerally speaking, there are two types of connectomes; macroscale and microscale. Macroscale connectomics refers to using functional and structural MRI data to map out large fiber tracts and functional gray matter areas within the brain in terms of blood flow (functional) and water diffusivity (structural). Microscale connectomics is the mapping of small organisms' complete connectome using microscopy and histology. That is, all connections that exist in their central nervous system."}

In this type of arrangement, the actual usage can vary from period to period, resulting in customer charges that vary as well.  Some customers like knowing that they will only pay for what they use, while other customers dislike the unpredictability of their bills."}

Over the contract term, there is no need to reassess the collectability for revenue recognition unless a significant change in facts and circumstances results in a significant deterioration in the customer’s creditworthiness. But we will not reverse revenue previously recognized. Accounts Receivable team can book bad debt allowance reserve and write off for non-payment. If the reassessment concludes that collectability criterion is not met, we need to stop future revenue. If the collectability criterion is still met, we will continue to take revenue, and Accounts Receivable can book bad debt allowance. If we conclude that a contract does not exist because the collectability criterion is not met, we don’t record a receivable for consideration that we have not yet received for the services we have already transferred to the customer. For the cash received, we recognize a deposit liability and record no related revenue. If the contract existence criteria is met upon reassessment, we would recognize a cumulative catch-up to revenue for the services already provided."}

Avoid clutter and too much distraction, but also feel free to use that part of the office to express yourself professionally. An interesting painting or a few professional accolades can be a good conversation starters.\n\n* Bright windows can be great for creativity but having these directly behind you when on video calls can give you a whitewashed look that's not ideal. Ideally, a window would be in front of you to not only cast your face in a good light, but also to give you a nice view as you work. If you can't position a window on front of your desk, you could always invest in good artificial lighting (e.g., a ring light) to help with video calls. \n\n* Avoid having positioning your desk so your back is directly in front of the office entrance. If you have line of site to all entrances / exits you'll likely feel more in control while working, which can make you more productive. \n\n* Position your desk so you have easy access to everything you'd need for work. Frequently used reference materials, papers, writing supplies, etc. should all be within arms length so as not to disrupt your \"flow\" while working."}

{"instruction": "Is it possible to raise your child trilingual?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. However there are a couple of things to keep in mind.

Parents should not mix languages as children need to learn that a specific person has to be addressed in a specific language, otherwise they learn that languages can be mixed. The passive skills are always bigger than the active language skills, don't give up too early! They will make use of their passive language skills at some point. It is easier to learn languages if you also listen to music, watch movies in different languages and have friends that speak those languages. Remember that every person is different. Even if you raise different kids the same way, some of them might learn languages easier than others. Languages are a gift that will always help you to understand other cultures, people and mindsets and expand your horizons."}

Proteomics enables the identification of ever-increasing numbers of proteins. This varies with time and distinct requirements, or stresses, that a cell or organism undergoes.\n\nProteomics is an interdisciplinary domain that has benefited greatly from the genetic information of various genome projects, including the Human Genome Project. It covers the exploration of proteomes from the overall level of protein composition, structure, and activity, and is an important component of functional genomics.\n\nProteomics generally denotes the large-scale experimental analysis of proteins and proteomes, but often refers specifically to protein purification and mass spectrometry. Indeed, mass spectrometry is the most powerful method for analysis of proteomes, both in large samples composed of millions of cells and in single cells."}

Measuring across issue domain tells us that knowing what an individual thinks about one issue doesn’t really tell you much about what they think of another issue.\nLevels of conceptualization are used to categorize people by use of ideological language in explaining their opinions.  There are five levels, the first is “ideologues”, when people rely on abstract concepts to make judgements about political objects.  Second, are “near-ideologues” who use ideological terminology, but don’t always use it correctly.  Third, are “group interest”, where people evaluate political objects with respect to their treatment of particular groups.  Fourth are “nature of the times”, when evaluations of candidates and parties are tied to general perceptions about how things are going.  Lastly, “no issue content”, where focus is on personalities or family traditions without any evidence of political thinking."}

For example, we can perform an echocardiogram with a color Doppler, where we can evaluate blood flow through the heart and create a picture of the heart and its moving valves. We can do a myocardial perfusion scan, which also evaluates blood flow in the heart. There’s also a procedure called electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT) which can detect calcium deposits in arteries. There’s also computed tomography angiography which reveals plaque or calcium deposits. We can perform a coronary MRI or MRA, which uses magnetic fields to detect valve problems, heart enlargement, vessel disease, damaged heart tissue, etc. Finally, we can also perform a coronary angiogram, which is invasive, but is the “gold standard” for diagnosing CAD. There are interventions available to Jing, which range from less invasive/intense to most intense. He can do daily things like reduce his high alcohol consumption, eat a heart-healthier and less inflammatory diet to help his cholesterol and triglyceride levels. There are also some medications to treat myocardial ischemia such as a daily aspirin, nitrates, beta blockers, cholesterol-lowering medications, etc. If his situation is very serious/deteriorates, he can consider angioplasty/stenting, or even coronary artery bypass surgery.

Long term users have seen Office evolve from its early days when it was installed on Windows machines to the relatively new Office 365 that is deployed online.  The key products in the Microsoft Office suite used by enterprises have been Word, Excel and Powerpoint. Google Docs is also an enterprise offering that consists of Docs, Sheets and Slides - these map to the corresponding Microsoft Office suite products listed.  Users who have been on Microsoft Office for many years find the move to Google Docs difficult.  This is because the commands across Google Docs are quite different to Office and one needs to spend time searching for MS office equivalent commands.  For example, the keyboard shortcut command to insert a freeze pane in windows excel is not the same in Google Sheets.  Formulae in cells and data analysis in Sheets is also different in sheets when compared to Excel. While it takes some time to unlearn commands and learn new ones as one moves from Microsoft Office to Google Docs, once one has spent some time working with Google Docs it starts to get easier.  And features such as ease of collaboration, never losing any content ever again, being able to work on the go from anywhere become the norm.  In summary, a user who has worked on Office for many years may find it difficult in the beginning but users who start with Google Docs will be comfortable from the beginning."}
{"instruction": "What is structural genomics?", "input": "", "output": "Structural genomics seeks to describe the 3-dimensional structure of every protein encoded by a given genome. This genome-based approach allows for a high-throughput method of structure determination by a combination of experimental and modeling approaches. The principal difference between structural genomics and traditional structural prediction is that structural genomics attempts to determine the structure of every protein encoded by the genome, rather than focusing on one particular protein. With full-genome sequences available, structure prediction can be done more quickly through a combination of experimental and modeling approaches, especially because the availability of large number of sequenced genomes and previously solved protein structures allows scientists to model protein structure on the structures of previously solved homologs.\n\nBecause protein structure is closely linked with protein function, the structural genomics has the potential to inform knowledge of protein function. In addition to elucidating protein functions, structural genomics can be used to identify novel protein folds and potential targets for drug discovery. Structural genomics involves taking a large number of approaches to structure determination, including experimental methods using genomic sequences or modeling-based approaches based on sequence or structural homology to a protein of known structure or based on chemical and physical principles for a protein with no homology to any known structure.\n\nAs opposed to traditional structural biology, the determination of a protein structure through a structural genomics effort often (but not always) comes before anything is known regarding the protein function. This raises new challenges in structural bioinformatics, i.e. determining protein function from its 3D structure.\n\nStructural genomics emphasizes high throughput determination of protein structures. This is performed in dedicated centers of structural genomics.\n\nWhile most structural biologists pursue structures of individual proteins or protein groups, specialists in structural genomics pursue structures of proteins on a genome wide scale. This implies large-scale cloning, expression and purification. One main advantage of this approach is economy of scale. On the other hand, the scientific value of some resultant structures is at times questioned. A Science article from January 2006 analyzes the structural genomics field.\n\nOne advantage of structural genomics, such as the Protein Structure Initiative, is that the scientific community gets immediate access to new structures, as well as to reagents such as clones and protein. A disadvantage is that many of these structures are of proteins of unknown function and do not have corresponding publications. This requires new ways of communicating this structural information to the broader research community. The Bioinformatics core of the Joint center for structural genomics (JCSG) has recently developed a wiki-based approach namely Open protein structure annotation network (TOPSAN) for annotating protein structures emerging from high-throughput structural genomics centers."}

{"instruction": "Is there any river that doesn’t meet a sea?", "input": "", "output": "There are several, in fact! The most famous example would be the Okavango River, which - instead of reaching the ocean - peters out into the massive Okavango Delta and evaporates, in the middle of the Kalahari Desert. Some other notable instances include the Onyx River - the longest river in Antarctica, at 32 kilometres in length - which simply flows from one lake to another. And the Omo River, which starts in the Ethiopian Highlands and ends in Lake Turkana, Kenya. But these last two flow into lakes. That’s not unusual for a river, right?\nCertainly not; however, in the vast majority of cases, the river’s water will meet the sea eventually, as almost all lakes are drained by other rivers which reach the ocean. Not so for these lakes. Why? Because they’re in what are known as endorheic basins. In hydrology, a basin is a region in which all precipitation will drain and collect into a common outlet. There are innumerable river basins throughout the world, with dozens in the (contiguous) US alone. If you look closely at the US map, you might notice that not all these river basins enter the sea. They are endorheic basins; closed, self-contained systems where the amount of water flowing in is equal to the amount which evaporates or seeps away.\nYou can theoretically find them in any climate, but they tend to be in very dry areas - e.g. the Kalahari - as where it’s rainier erosion will usually carve pathways to the ocean. They also often have mountains or glaciers blocking their way to the sea. Endorheic basins make up about 18 per cent of the world’s land area - although this map doesn’t show the ones in Antarctica.\nAlso note that 6 of the world’s 25 largest lakes are in endorheic basins - Lakes Turkana, Balkhash, Titicaca, Issyk-kul, and Urmia, and of course the Caspian Sea - the largest lake in all the world."}

{"instruction": "What are a couple of simple tricks to make a simple wood carving look more polished and professional?", "input": "", "output": "Okay the first obvious point to make here is that the thing that will make any piece of art - including a wood carving - look more professional is the quality of the art!  That means the skill and the artistic quality that goes into it, specifically.  But there are a couple things you can do to dress it up a bit - think about your school days and sliding that english paper into a fresh new folder with a carefully penned title on the front. So back to wood carving.  What can you do?  Let's say you've carved yourself a nice salmon complete with fens and gill lines.  Well here are three ways to dress it up.  First and most obvious  - paint it.  You can go for detail paint or you can use more of a water color approach that will give the wood a colored wash.  The sky is really the limit here.  Second, you mount it on a stand so it floats about the ground.  Drill a small whole in the bottom of the fish, do the same in a wood block you've sanded up and you have s stand.  Third and a bit more out there - consider if there are simple additions you can add.  I made an angler fish and used a drive flower with stem as the attached antenna.  Look around and think about what you can add to your project.  Last and most basic, put a coat of varnish on it to seal it up - and if you choose give it a bit of shine.  All these ideas will give a little bit of extra finish and pop to your project."}

{"instruction": "Who is the greatest basketball player of all time?", "input": "", "output": "While this question continues to be debated by sports fans and pundits around the globe nearly every single day, usually the answer comes down to one of a handful of players: Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, LeBron James, or Bill Russell.\n\nMichael Jordan is the most common answer to this question. He won 6 championship rings, 5 MVP's and never lost an NBA Finals series. If he didn't take a two year hiatus from the NBA to play baseball, there is a good chance that he would have won 8 NBA championships in a row. Michael was a fantastic defender, and arguably the most relentless competitor that the NBA has ever seen. He was notorious for gambling on almost anything, and his iconic Air Jordan shoe is largely responsible for Nike's success as a global brand.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar was, until recently, the NBA's all time leading scorer. He played 20 seasons in the NBA, was a 19-time All-Star, 6-time MVP, and a 6-time NBA champion. He was incredibly consistent throughout his entire career, and transcended the NBA as a civil rights activist, author and even an actor.\n\nLeBron James is the greatest NBA player of this generation. He is a five-time NBA champion, four-time MVP, and recently surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the NBA's all time leading scorer. No player came in to the NBA with greater expectations, and somehow, LeBron surpassed them all. LeBron first made headlines at age 15, and many of his high school games were nationally televised. \n\nBill Russell was the ultimate teammate. In 13 seasons in the NBA he won 11 titles, all as a member of the Boston Celtics. During his last two seasons, he won the title as a Player/Coach, also becoming the first black coach to win an NBA title. Russell was a five-time MVP and 12-time NBA All Star, and is widely respected as the best defensive player of his era. He had a well-publicized rivalry with Wilt Chamberlain, but while Wilt chased stats, Bill made sure his team won. \n\nIn addition to these four, there have been many other amazing basketball players over the years, including modern stars like Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, the late Kobe Bryant, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and more. Debating who is the best player ever is part of what makes basketball so entertaining. So while most people may say that Michael Jordan is the greatest player ever, this debate will rage on for years to come as more and more stars enter the league and build their careers."}

The gospel's concluding verses set out its purpose, \"that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name\n5) Acts of the Apostles - is an attempt to answer a theological problem, namely how the Messiah, promised to the Jews, came to have an overwhelmingly non-Jewish church; the answer it provides, and its central theme, is that the message of Christ was sent to the Gentiles because the Jews rejected it"}

{"instruction": "Why is it important to brush and floss your teeth everyday?", "input": "", "output": "It is important to use a toothbrush to remove food build-up and plaque that can accumulate on tooth surfaces.  Flossing is important to remove build-up in between teeth in the areas a toothbrush cannot reach.  If plaque is not removed within 24 hours, it can harden into calculus which can only be removed with a professional cleaning.  If plaque and calculus remain on teeth it can increase the risk of gum disease and cavities.  Maintaining a healthy mouth is important for oral health as well as systemic health, e.g. Cardiovascular Health.    Dentists recommend to brush your teeth twice a day for 2 minutes each time and flossing at least once a day.  When brushing it is best to wait 30 minutes after drinking acidic beverages, such as coffee or citrus juice.  Dentists recommend using a soft bristle toothbrush with gentle pressure and using toothpaste with fluoride which can help reduce the risk of cavities by strengthening the enamel."}

{"instruction": "What is the history of coffee?", "input": "", "output": "Much of the early history of coffee was tied to oral tradition in modern-day Ethiopia. Presently, there is no evidence of coffee consumption and cultivation before the 15th century. Yemeni monks drank coffee to aid in concentration during prayers. In the early 16th century, coffee spread to the Levant and Persia. Later in the 16th-century coffee arrived in Italy via Mediterranean trade routes. The Ottomans brought it to Central and Eastern Europe. It reached India by the mid-17th century.England and Germany pioneered the coffee house concept that emerged in Western Europe. The Caribbean island of Martinique hosted one of the earliest ex-situ coffee cultivations in the New World - Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings here in 1720. These resulted in coffee plantations in other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue (which, by 1788, supplied half of the world's coffee) and also in Mexico.Brazil is currently the largest coffee producer globally, a status held since 1852. Since 1950, a number of other major producers emerged, including Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam. Today, coffee is a household item as a result of modern production techniques and mass productization."}

Why am I on the floor? I'm right behind this man, he's just got out of bed. I don't recognise this room. \n\nAh. I seem to be a shadow. Not what I was hoping for this morning, if I'm being honest. I have a big day at work, and this is going to make things rather more challenging. I'll have to get on with it though, stiff upper lip and all that. I can only hope this my shadow's driver has an interesting plan for the day. \n\nIt's looking promising so far. They are putting on hiking boots and other outdoor wear. Certainly better than staying inside and playing video games all day. I'd hardly have anything to do at all. Now we need to hope for some good weather. If we're in Norway, there isn't much light at this time of the year. I'd barely even exist. \n\nFinally, he's opened the curtains. I've struck gold. We're in the Sierra Nevada mountains in Spain, and it's a clear day. \n\nWe're outside and we're climbing. This is fun! But scary! I never climbed before in my real body. I wish he would stop sitting down to rest. I don't like being sat on. \n\nThe view from the summit, it's finally here. It's amazing. Or at least that is what the man says. As a 2 dimensional shadow, I can't really see much. I'm not tall enough."}

{"instruction": "What is geomorphometry?", "input": "", "output": "Geomorphometry, or geomorphometrics, is the science and practice of measuring the characteristics of terrain, the shape of the surface of the Earth, and the effects of this surface form on human and natural geography. It gathers various mathematical, statistical and image processing techniques that can be used to quantify morphological, hydrological, ecological and other aspects of a land surface. Common synonyms for geomorphometry are geomorphological analysis (after geomorphology), terrain morphometry, terrain analysis, and land surface analysis. Geomorphometrics is the discipline based on the computational measures of the geometry, topography and shape of the Earth's horizons, and their temporal change. This is a major component of geographic information systems (GIS) and other software tools for spatial analysis.\n\nIn simple terms, geomorphometry aims at extracting (land) surface parameters (morphometric, hydrological, climatic etc.) and objects (watersheds, stream networks, landforms etc.) using input digital land surface model (also known as digital elevation model, DEM) and parameterization software.[Extracted surface parameters and objects can then be used, for example, to improve mapping and modelling of soils, vegetation, land use, geomorphological and geological features and similar.\n\nWith the rapid increase of sources of DEMs today (and especially due to the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and LIDAR-based projects), extraction of land surface parameters is becoming more and more attractive to numerous fields ranging from precision agriculture, soil-landscape modelling, climatic and hydrological applications to urban planning, education and space research. The topography of almost all Earth has been today sampled or scanned, so that DEMs are available at resolutions of 100 m or better at global scale. Land surface parameters are today successfully used for both stochastic and process-based modelling, the only remaining issue being the level of detail and vertical accuracy of the DEM."}

{"instruction": "Tell me about the various road types in USA?", "input": "", "output": "The public road system in United States of America is primarily made up of Highways and Local Roads. The United States Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration (FWHA) classifies roads based on functions which are created based on attributes such as speed limits, route length and spacing. Based on the road functions we can categorize roads into the following categories.\n1. Interstates and Arterial System\n2. Other Arterials\n3. Collectors\n4. Locals\n\nThe interstate system is the at the top of road function classification system. They include Highways and Freeways with the highest speed limits and which allow for long distance travel without a lot of interruption. They are constructed using precise standards, signage and with safety considerations. They are also sometimes referred to as Arterial roads as they provide vital connectivity across regions in America. Interstate 95 or I-95 is an example of one such highway in the east coast of the United States which runs from Florida to Maine. The Principal Arterial system also comprises of U.S. Highways, which provide connectivity across regions which do not have an Interstate to support travel.\n\nOther Arterials also include freeways and highways which supplement the Interstate system explained above. They have a slightly lesser speed limits. They typically connect cities and urban areas. Consider them as being minor highways. As an example, North Carolina Highway 55 (NC-55) is a primary state highway artery connecting multiple regional and urban areas in the state of North Carolina.\n\nCollectors are critical for connecting urban population using local roads with the Interstate highways where applicable. They have more interruptions and are shorter in lengths. They also have lesser speed limits (30-35 mph). These can comprise of State highways which connect local roads with the Arterial highways.\n\nFinally local roads provide connectivity between communities, regions, farms and other local areas. They form the lion's share of the United States road system."}
{"instruction": "What is one-child policy?", "input": "", "output": "The \"one-child policy\" was a Chinese population planning initiative that was implemented from 1980 to 2015 to curb population growth by limiting many families to only one child. It was part of a larger effort to control population growth that began in 1970 and ended in 2021, which included setting minimum ages for marriage and childbearing, imposing two-child limits on many couples, requiring minimum intervals between births, close monitoring, and imposing stiff fines for non-compliance. The policy had far-reaching social, cultural, economic, and demographic effects, although the extent to which the one-child restrictions contributed to the broader program has been a matter of debate."}
