Our plan for the day was to infiltrate the Massif des Maures area and search for one of France's most endangered reptiles-- the western Hermann's tortoise.  The first stop of our quest was Le Village de Tortues (the Tortoise Village), a tortoise rehabilitation center near the town of Gonfaron. Our mission was to befriend a staff member, learn as much as we could, and get detailed information on tracking down the wily Hermann's tortoise in the wild. When we couldn't find an English-speaking staff member, our mission was nearly thwarted. Only through quick thinking and improvisation were we able to acquire the vital background information we needed. Okay - we utilized the signs provided for British visitors. For many people, the word tortoise invokes thoughts of giant four-foot-long Galapagos tortoises. Western Hermann's tortoises, on the other hand, are small, reaching a maximum length of eight inches. While both reptiles make the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the Galapagos tortoise is listed as \"vulnerable\" and the western Hermann's is listed as \"endangered.\" In France, habitat destruction, egg pilfering, and fire are the primary factors for the tortoises decline.", "input": "", "output": "I WILL FIND YOU"}

The Liberal Democrats’ home affairs spokesperson, Alistair Carmichael, said: “These comments show Suella Braverman is in complete denial about the impact of the Conservative government’s botched deal with Europe on our borders. For Conservative ministers like Braverman, it is always someone else’s fault.\n\n“Businesses and travellers are being tied up in reams of red tape but ministers are refusing to lift a finger. It shows the Conservative party is out of touch, out of excuses and should be out of power.”\n\nThe former Conservative cabinet minister David Gauke, who was stripped of the Tory whip for rebelling in a Brexit vote, tweeted: “If we were in the EU, the French would not need to do individual passport checks. If no individual passport checks, the process at Dover would be quicker. The Dover queues are, therefore, partly caused by Brexit. Not a contentious point, surely?”\n\nCaroline Lucas, the Green party MP, described Braverman as being “on another planet as usual”. She said that the home secretary’s comments regarding no Brexit link contradicted those expressed by the port’s chief executive.
